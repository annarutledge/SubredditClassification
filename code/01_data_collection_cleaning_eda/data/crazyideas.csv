10,Better long-term orientation for democracies with a additional long-term parlament,"I think the government terms/cycle (time between elections for national government) in democracies are too short, to have a good long-term orientation and strategy.
Political parties have different opinions / visions about the future, yet their behavior while being elected a very similar. They focus is mostly on the current term till the next election, half a year before every election they stop any slightly controversial moves -not to upset potential voters- and after the election need weeks or months to form a government.

To combat this short-term thinking I would propose a long-term parlament next to the regular parlament. The regular parlament can keep their 4 year term-time and the long-term parlament is elected every 10 years (to stay longer than two regular parlament terms, but not too long).
The advantages of a long-term parlament would be:
1. Political discussion can take years to come to a decision to be based on the best possible available and researched data.
2. They can set the planning for their thought through decisions, which will be executed by the regular parlament.
3. They can discuss and plan topics unfavorable seen in the regular parlament as well as certain industries, organizations (like abandoning fossil fuels and right of assisted dying).
4. The regular parlament could focus completely on the day business of a government.
5. (long-term) Plans can't be easy overthrown, like in the US were they cancel or block the other sides plans.
6. Political discussion can become constructive again and collective decision of the majority would overrule the requirement of forming an alliance to have a constant majority in the parlament.
7. The ageing of the population brings the future orientated youth in a disadvantage in every election. To keep the orientation of the democracy on the future, there is an age restriction for voting only allowing voter from 16 years old until average life expectancy minus one generation (currently ~54 - 58); every 5 years there is an in-between election for the people how turned 16 in the meantime.
8. The long-term parlament would give the political security and stability to execute long-term political decisions.

Requirements for the long-term parlament: every parlament member is restricted to a one term max, minimum amount of political parties (≥3), parties should also reach a minimum percentage of total votes (~3%), only the total amount of votes for election are counted (so no vote is lost due to regional votes) and party members don't have to follow party's consent.",arnelucas,1643303472

I'd kill to go to school tomorrow and learn how to take care of myself and learn about the system and learn about my health and sex health. I remember nothing that was taught to me and I didn't have any organizational skills but I had such high expectations on me and for myself. There are so many people who are stuck learning the wrong things and not learning what they need to do or having time to make mistakes, they don't develop far enough to make an actual life choice especially with how the world is and how difficult having a family and going to school is nowadays.

If they're going to force it, then adults should be able to have the time they need instead of being under pressure learning things that aren't necessary and all kids should be able to understand what they are doing and to be able to get early help if they need it. Being old enough or being older than what the expected age for the content would also reduce the time it took for students to learn and they could get help if they needed it. They would be able to learn more or have time to process and get experience and have more time for social and emotional development instead of losing sleep and sitting in a classroom. If children started later, we could understand their individual needs. This would make It easier to have smaller class sizes, which has been proven to be beneficial. School would be more comprehensible and inclusive and stimulating. Teens are still reaching milestones and experience, a lot are not ready to make choices that affect their careers and relationships, some don't have capacity for high expectations of juggling many things plus becoming adults. The world is changing and the people are having different lifestyles and different needs as adults and different options, they can't just be crammed with all that information. I think throwing them out there with nothing, along with teaching them as 14 year children instead of as adults who will need to manage work or home care, is the reason why so many people are struggling.

Also, the life expectancy is changing, there's no reason we can't take a few extra years to change how the future generation turns out with the way our culture is compared to how it used to be. Using the same system is not working.

I think people would also be humbled. There are 17-year-old kids who think they're ready to do everything just because they're finishing school, including my younger self, and they have the lack of experience and education that leads to them making choices that can affect their lives or even endanger them.",MoistCurdyMaxiPad,1643264541

Fine, but the bank has to prove that the person taking out a loan in your name is you. If you want to take out a loan, you might have to bring government-issued ID and any other documents needed to tie your SSN or driver's license number to you. If the bank doesn't ask for proof, then they can't sue you or file the debt with the credit reporting agency.

The credit reporting agencies would be required to ask for similar levels of proof before adding a debt that someone incurred in your name to your credit report.

Similarly, if someone gets arrested and uses your name to identify themselves, the police have to prove that someone is you before definitively listing ""you.""

The aforementioned agencies could still keep the relevant records, with the understanding that any connection between you and the person who identified as you is tenuous at best, and note in their records accordingly. Then if they eventually do gather proof that you are the person who claimed they are you, they can amend the records.  For example, instead of saying: ""Person X, SSN# Y owes us $500"" a bank could say ""A person who claims their name is X and SSN# is Y owes us $500.""

71,4 Ideas I Love From Daily Idea,"Howdy Reddit, here are 4 ideas I love from the site I’ve been building:

## #1: Scotch Tape Style Roller Dispenser For Band Aids

**Idea:** Band Aids should be easier to open. Maybe have them on a dispenser roll like tape.

**Why I love it:** Uh yes… This makes total sense. Those 2 little tearoff plastic pieces + opening the single serving paper for every bandaid is a frustration every time. This just resonated with me personally. I don’t know if it’s a standalone startup idea, but I sure wish bandaid makers would have this option.

*Original Link:* [*https://www.dailyidea.com/i/rf10ao/band-aids*](https://www.dailyidea.com/i/rf10ao/band-aids)

## #2: Summer Camp For Content Creators

**Idea:** Run a “summer camp” for youtube/social media/tiktok/etc creators. A cross between ""summer camp"" and ""industry conferences"". Bring in specialists/experts/super famous creators to teach classes and give talks (video editing, production, how the algorithms work, etc). Set up peer groups for mutual learning/sharing. All in an amazing, inspiring location where content creators can take advantage of the local culture (Swiss Alps, Mexico City, The Smokey Mountains, Bali)

**Why I love it:** It feels like a next logical extension for the creator economy. It would be a lot of fun for creators (go to awesome places), and it’s just basically a business / industry conference for this section of the economy. It monetizes exactly like the conference / business training industry but it’s way more fun.

## #3: Relive Iconic Historical Moments In AR/VR

**Idea:**

I think there are already apps for say, visiting the Pantheon in Athens or the Colosseum in Rome in VR (if not, do that first).

A cool extension would be to relive iconic historical moments, not just places.

So to be able to virtually walk the field of the 85 Bears Super Bowl game WHILE they are playing it, press play, pause, or slow-mo on time at any point, then walk around it.

Manipulate time and space of your favorite events.

Extend that to:

* every championship game across all sports (you'll get fans for each one)
* Presidential inaugurations, political rallies
* Famous speeches - I have a dream, the Gettysburg Address, etc
* Legendary concerts or festivals - The Beatles, Rolling Stone, Woodstock

Basically the business is building up the IP for 3d models of event footage, like Getty does for images. You can license them and sell for all sorts of purposes. They can be used for entertainment (charge admission to specialized virtual events like a movie).

Bonus - Rent out the ACTUAL Colosseum, give a bunch of people AR goggles, let them ALL walk around the actual PHYSICAL original space with an AR overlay of a particular fight or something. Julius Caesar is up in the stands watching. Rent out the Palace of Versailles during a banquet, or the signing of a historical document.

**Why I love it**: It would just be so cool!

## #4: Freelancer Collaboration Platform

TLDR: Upwork, but payment in services barter only.

**Idea:** A platform where freelancers can connect with other freelancers to complete a part of the work they can’t do. Users would trade services instead of payment.

E.G. I am a web dev who has the ability to do most of the work on my website, but I need a designer and a dev with a different skillset to round it out. I would engage with designers/devs to fill in the gaps for me and would help them in kind on their work.

**Why I love it**: Lots of talented people are able to do one part of a startup (design, dev, copywriting, marketing, etc), but not all of it. Sometimes it’s easier to trade services than pay cash.

74,In the USA there are 500K Uber drivers working for about 12 bucks per hour. How about we socialize Rideshare and all drivers make double their income ?,"In the USA there is 500K Americans that drive for Uber. In the USA there 50 states and this 500K Americans ÷ 50 States averages about 10,000 drivers PER each state in the USA.

How can we guarantee success? Simplifying the system, uber confuses driver into believe they are nothing by keeping them poor and not motivated because with money and motivated this idea I mention can happen tomorrow. Uber is Global and they use that tactic.....many people immediately think 🤔  ohhhh I cant make an APP like Uber and thats true however there is no need to overthink that because we dont need a WORLDWIDE app. We simply would divide Uber into example; 50 Divisions/ 1 per state. By separating it like this the servers are more streamlined and cases can be handled easier as its a state to state issue.

How to socialize Rideshare ? I would suggest investing.  As mentioned above there are averages of 10,000 drivers PER all 50 states in the USA.
When 10,000 drivers can all save a measly 🤣🤦🏾‍♂️ 500  dollars each the total is 5 million dollars.

This 5 million dollars is ABSOLUTELY enough to create an app example; 10,000 drivers who all live in FLORIDA save and pool 500 bucks each and now this 5 million dollars will absolutely create a simple Uber/Lyft clone . Why will 5 million be enough??? Because the server and operating cost are low because the app will ONLY serve FLORIDA. This will allow for very little resources on all aspects. 

How much will drivers be paid and how will the company make money to pay example; servers,factory where developers, human resources, customers service ???? 

Simple; every driver keeps 90% of earnings from every trip they make. To put that into perspective if Uber drivers kept 90% of earnings every driver would make 50K cash plus salary per year.

Example on how this can work ; keep in mind that on average a Uber driver does 3 trips PER hour and the average trip is 10 bucks each trip. So example; lets say at 10am absolutely all 10,000 drivers make these 3 trips each and thus make 30 bucks in 1 hour. Since we said drivers keep 90% of earnings then every driver will make 27dollars that hour and 3 bucks goes to the community operating pot.

10,000 drivers × 3 bucks that hour = 30,000 dollars and if all drivers work 5 hours a day = 150K and if they all want to live a happy life and only work 20 days a month its 150k × 15 days of work per month = 2 million dollar monthly budget. 

This 2 million is absolutely enough to cover server cost and payroll.

110,Gravity is high frequency light dispersing in an opto-electrical system,"If we live in an opto-electrical system, the speed of light in the medium would be the limiting factor. What we call atoms are just coherent waveforms at a higher frequency than we can work with, right now at least, and the optical system has close to zero dispersion at that wavelength of light. The dispersion is gravity, with Einstein's theory of relativity, light dispersing could be like a room with a floor moving upward compared to a person standing in a room with gravity. Coherent light waveforms can add in various ways we call chemical reactions, and atoms don't attract each other based on mass, rather,  coherent light expands, and a summation of that expansion is what we perceive as gravity. Could a black hole be a near perfect absorber, a sensor in the  opto-electrical computing system? It seems this sort of system could also be made within itself, making reality a sort of fractal where the deeper you look the slower the time scale is (light travels at slower speeds based on index of refraction if the material) and the deeper you look the lower the energy level. We are the noise, products of dispersion, in a potentially infinite stack of simulated universes networks, resulting in what we call the universe, at lower and lower energy levels. Given this, what is the original speed of light? Our speed of light would be slower if what we consider a vacuum as really an optical cavity of a given index of refraction. Is our optical internet backbone already a pseudo-recreation of the universe?",Rofleson,1643106068

Honestly, simply existing has value, more so now than ever. Where you go, what you do, what you buy, look at, smell, touch. Everything you do generates data that other people are profiting off of. I'm being hyperbolic but seriously, everyone's individual data combined is massively valuable. It only makes sense that you should be paid for your data. However, how do quantify your data's value? Once you do, do you really want dozens (hundreds) of tiny payments? How would you even get paid those tiny payments? 

Enter in, the UBI Taxing Data profits fund. Aside from having totally original and fun name, it makes the most sense of any tax ever. Based off of a companies data driven profits, they pay into a special fund. That fund is then dispersed evenly to everyone as Universal Basic Income. 

Obviously, some people generate way more data and value than other people. Doesn't matter, we all get a slice of the pie. Data should be kept anonymous and there's also the very important fact of ""fuck you there totes aren't' any plot holes"".

268,An unstoppable assassin who kills the person whose name was typed on a web site the most times by a single person,"Think about what would happen.  People would drop everything to type the names of their enemies.  The assassin doesn't say how long the contest is for, so they'd have to keep typing.  It lasts years.  People give their kids absurdly long names with difficult to type character sequences.  The supply chain is broken- people can't afford to stop typing.  It becomes illegal to own keyboards of any kind.  Life grinds to a halt.  Without data entry, there can be no data.  We return to a rural agrarian existence- for those who survived the food riots, that is.  Countries topple.  All knowledge of science is lost.  Literacy becomes reviled, and those who can read are treated like witches in the Inquisition.  

Then PLOT TWIST: the assassin never intended to kill anyone.  He just wanted to bring about the fall of civilization with the least possible effort.  
  
DOUBLE PLOT TWIST:  The people of the world knew all about the assassin's clever ploy.  But they felt bad for him and played along- even to the extent of starving themselves and their families, stoning intellectuals in the street, and cutting off the fingers of anyone caught typing.  Of course, they had to hide their sniggering laughter behind their (sometimes fingerless) hands whenever the assassin was around.  But that was half the fun.  In the end, they let the assassin in on the joke, and they all (at least the ones who survived the riots, that is) hugged in the burnt-out ruins of a stately manor home once rumored to harbor a school for secretaries.",hendergle,1642727959

This way food isn’t ending up in the dumpsters but in the stomachs of those who are hungry.

Distributing a new build of your application and having to guide a bunch of people around microsoft security. Microsoft and some others want you to pay for a certificate to say your software is safe / trustworthy - but it's also possible that if enough people just trust your software, it eventually gets into the security databases and this becomes a little bit less of an issue. Several vendors are competing with microsoft to offer you a code certificate, but all want hundreds of dollars a year! It's like web certificates before *letsencrypt* became a thing. Unfortunately microsoft may be in a position to prevent a similar thing from happening on their own OS. 

Except for itch. With itch, people can distribute games through a launcher that suppresses the warnings. It's like a crowd sourced executable trust platform! Imagine that for non game software - instead of paying microsoft $300-$400 a year, you could have a trusted platform to launch your software from that would build trust for your executable and self generated certificates!

338,A widespread move to vegetarianism and veganism may be more palatable if we honor and respect why we naturally crave meat to begin with.,"Meat has become so common place that we either 1) eat it without thinking or 2) make a deliberate attempt to steer a diet away from it.  This is contrary to the past: everyone's ancestors really had to fight to hunt for meat or even spend a lot of effort to tend to it once agriculture developed.  

Currently, people subscribe to vegetarianism and veganism largely for health, environmental, or ethical (animal care) reasons. There are many people who may be aware of these reasons (and often consider converting) but continue eating meat for any number of other reasons. For those who are on the fence and who can reasonably eat less meat, rather than making the leap to outright rejecting reasons why someone would want to eat meat, maybe they should find a middle ground. Eat less meat by thinking about what our ancestors did for meat with thoughtfulness and dignity rather than just something to be rejected outright or randomly consumed every meal. For example ask questions about why is eating meat beautiful? why is eating meat special? how much energy is required to get this meat to the table? what do I get out of eating this meat? How did we develop this practice of eating meat in our lives? Is this average mediocre take out really worth the energy put into cutting up this meat?

A culture that is more respectful to the reasons of the past may help humanize both vegetarians/vegans and non-vegetarians/vegans to each other, and help people understand why it's so hard for society as a whole to just flip the switch. By acknowledging both our past and where we could go in the future, this somehow helps both society and individuals stomach eating meat a little less?",fjaoaoaoao,1642538376

Players would spawn into a series of islands and would encounter monsters instead of the normal mobs, like giant praying mantises, giant condors, basically the whole place would be filled with strong monsters and mini bosses to fight, but there would also be a vast underground world to explore filled with dangerous monsters and easter eggs.
Events would also happen, but mostly would be caused by players themselves, like finding blueprints to make the (in)famous Jet Jaguar to help players fight monsters, or ancient weather control devices that would mutate some of the monsters, like for example turning the giant praying mantises into Kamacuras, or even an unfortunate player discovering and awaking Godzilla himself
Events started by devs would also happen, like the arrival of Ghidorah to destroy the island, and the arrival of Zone Fighter to stop him. Also, maybe if the island gets too destroyed by events or players, Mothra would arrive to reset everything back to it's original state.
Maybe, if the server gets popular enough, Bagan himself would appear as a mega boss.

OK maybe it's not for everyone but I think this is a clever way of saving milk.

If you ever eat cereal and pour milk onto it, then let the cereal soak in the milk for a while. Eat the cereal out of the bowl and if there is any milk remaining (which, for this to work, ought to be a fair amount), pour that milk into your cup containing boiled water mixed with coffee shots or tea bags.

On top of having milk in your cup without having to go and get more out of the jug/carton/bottle, your coffee will have cereal flavours in it.

After dropping a used container in the recycling, sanitation companies could bring them back to a facility where they’re thoroughly cleaned and then return them to manufacturers for relabeling and reuse. Because there would be a limited and standardized number of form factors for containers, sanitation/recycling plants could easily sort them for return after cleaning.

As a result:
- We would stop using many single-use plastics
- This would shrink our contributions to the huge amount of plastic trash
- Businesses would have to spend much less on materials
- We would produce less emissions through plastic production

While there is too much apathy about protecting the environment from plastics, I don’t think there would be much pushback either. Do consumers really care about the material and shape of containers their sodas, delivery food, medicines, and other deliverables come in? Would people care that much if a Coke bottle were thicker and got cleaned and reused? Would companies mind having less control over the shape of their products if it cost less to produce them?

The main antagonist to this plan is of course the plastic industry, which would be formidable. But as with the adoption of sustainable energy, hopefully the combination of environmental sustainability and better economics would win out and send plastics into decline.",yellowhatb,1642446293

It would make hardware a lot simpler, it would make home-ownership more affordable, and it would reduce pollution and CO2 hazards a lot. Thousands of people die every year from these things.

Think of every single house that has a gas boiler? gas water heater? oil boiler? Almost every house north of the equator everywhere on earth has one. and it's burning gas and wasting resources and polluting neighborhoods. It requires acres of factories and pipe maintenance or ships and trucks, all wasting millions in resources.

With the advent of high tech clean power plants, dam power,wind and solar, and nuclear plants, this should be a no-brainer. Electricity can be produced very cheaply. Some cities around the world have EXTREMELY low eletric utility rates, a QUARTER as high as in developed nations, because electric utility is a for-profit business.

The cost of gasoline for cars would also drop tremendously, solving yet ANOTHER problem.

Such a simple subsidy has the potential to stop global warming and make the world a better place for everyone. But then you think about it, and you realize that such a simple step would also completely destroy the oil and natural gas industries, hundreds of boiler manufacturers, and thousands of service providers.

452,COVID is a SMOKESCREEN; Fauci made a BIO-WEAPON; China Saves Face,"In 2019 a BIO WEOPON was accidentally released from a Level 4 Virology lab in Wuhan, China. This after the science and funding was moved there from the United States by Anthony Fauci of the NIH in support of Gain of Function research with the end goal of developing targeted, phenotype specific weaponry. The actual bio weapon that was released was not what we call COVID19 today, or any of the variants from that which we are currently dealing with. Instead it was an ACTUAL bio weapon that was designed to kill quickly and certainly. This bio weapon was / is so deadly that people who contract it die within hours to seconds after transmission. Do you recall people dropping dead in the streets of China in 2019? It was transmissible not only through the air but also via contact and was responsible for 10s of thousands of undocumented deaths in China and few outside of the country.

In order to stop the immeasurable damage this weapon would have caused it became necessary for the governments of the world to collude and conspire to create a novel coronavirus that would be slightly more aggressive than the common flu virus. This virus would be released and used to cajole the population of the world into a state of fear and panic that would permit them to undergo mass surveillance in the form of testing.

The testing of the populace of the world has multiple purposes. The first and primary objective was, and continues to be, to locate and identify every instance of the actual escaped bio weapon, isolate it, and control its further transmission. When you get tested for COVID19 you're being test for two things; COVID19 and the bio-weapon. If you tested positive for the bio weapon you would test positive for COVID19, however, you get a mark on your record that also would indicate the presence of the actual bio-weapon. Those with the bio-weapon mark were handled differently than those who simply tested positive for COVID19 alone.

COVID19 was developed and released to focus the world populace into compliance for the testing procedures because had the actual bio-weapon continued to spread unchecked, it would have resulted in essentially what can only be described as a ""hell on earth"" scenario. By releasing a more aggressive flu-like virus onto the world, it not only provided a ""smokescreen"" to handle the bio-weapon in the wild, it also has provided the governments of the world DNA information (phenotypes) of nearly the population of earth. Targeted assassination and genocide of entire phenotype groups can now be administered by simply engineering a new communicable disease where only the target becomes affected with a lethal outcome.

**Why not just come clean from the beginning?**

To put it simply, China would not have it. One of the most important attributes of Chinese society is saving face. The CCP would rather dissolve into ashes than lose face on the world stage and by admitting that this bio-weapon was not only in development, but also that it escaped a supposedly secure facility, the governments and populations of the world would all point their fingers squarely at them. China not only would have to fit the bill for whatever recovery was necessary, but would also, and more importantly, lose face on the world stage. So, because China basically has the world by balls in nearly every single economic category worth considering, the world had no choice but to play along with this cover story.

**What's the deal with the gene therapy shots being billed as ""vaccines""?**

The inoculation of the world populace was not supposed to start this soon. This wasn't supposed to begin for another 5 years but as a result of the accidental release of the bio-weapon, the cabal that insists on depopulating the world had to push their agenda up a lot sooner than they had originally planned. There was supposed to be a more nuanced approach, but an opportunity presented itself that could not go unused and thus here we are today.

“The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis.' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger--but recognize the opportunity.” ― John F. Kennedy

**Why didn't they just let the BIO-WEAPON run its course if depopulation is the ultimate agenda?**

Simply because they were not ready. The structures are not fully in place yet to support 7 out 8 people dying yet. If the weapon were left to its own devices, those who they didn't intend to kill would have died and their vision for the humanity of the future could not possibly come into fruition.

470,City cash bonus for healthy choices &amp; good citizenship,"Remedial social services such as policing, detention, detective work, animal shelters, and road expansion are costly in many ways. Cities can save money and promote collaborative citizenship if they give citizens an actual annual disbursement that rewards good citizenship and healthy physical and emotional life choices. Every year, in October, you'd fill out a form to the city and submit proof of participation. Then, in time for holiday shopping, you'd get a reward that's calculated on:

If you're married, you stayed married (pre-marriage and marriage counseling should be free city services)

If you got married this year, you attended pre-marriage counseling

You are employed (employees should also be allowed to annually rate employers that pay payroll tax)

You have had no arrests, traffic tickets, or citations

You self-submitted info on a healthy or improving physical

If in school, you made good grades

If you're a parent, your kids made good grades and had no school discipline reports

If you decided to become a parent this year, you attended parenting classes.

If you decided not to have more children, you took advantage of long-term or permanent birth control.

You have a home and auto security system and keep your car garaged. Extra bonus if you have security cameras/dash cam that identify offenders. Maximum bonus, however, if you electively do not have a car and use public transit instead.

You have turned in a fire-safety check form for your dwelling

You participated in municipal recycling

You have energy-saving devices, such as rain barrels, low-flow shower heads, motion-sensor porch lights, or a white roof.

Your property has tree cover or you planted new trees, or participated in municipal tree planting if your apartment building doesn't have tree space or a flat roof for plants.

You used public transit 

You used your library card

You donated blood

You are First Aid and CPR certified

If you have pets, they are neutered, vaccinated, and secured on your property - not picked up by animal control. Deduction for non-neutered pets that reproduced, unless you have a breeder's license.

You attended at least one cultural event, such as a concert, play, lecture, or museum. You get a bigger bonus if you attended a community arts organization such as theatre or community band concert in the park.

You are a member of a municipal organization, such as neighborhood watch, block club, PTA, garden club, community garden, community band, sports/athletic club like running, cycling or basketball club, or you volunteer at a municipal service including food bank, hospital, homeless or pet shelter, community center, or volunteer in public schools.

You participated in professional development or continuing education as either a student or instructor. This can include taking classes at a community center.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously, not all these will apply to every citizen, every year, but you would go online and chalk up as many as you can. You'd see surges of people getting on public transit and using their library cards before the deadline! The city can issue periodic prompts during the year, as well as keep a leader board of super citizens. Psychologically, humans are more motivated by the fear of losing an award, so your good-citizen award can be shown as a maximum amount that gets deductions, so you try hard to keep your maximum annual bonuses.

The rewards bonuses would not be huge amounts of cash, and people will complain ""I volunteered at the food bank and my annual reward only turned out to be $1 an hour"" because people want something for nothing and like to complain. It would not equate to the city offering you a paid job to volunteer. That's not the point. The point is to increase awareness, promote community participation in healthy activities, and focus awareness on the cost of remedial services vs. the benefits of collaboration. Data exists to inform citizens of the per-capita cost of ONE arrest, detention, investigation, and court proceeding. Imagine how that can be multiplied if people were getting paid to stay honest and keep their fellow citizens honest. The more the city saves on policing (for example) as it becomes less necessary, the more they can rebate to citizens, so people will try to influence each other toward peaceful and honest years, so the annual rewards will grow over time. In January, cities can release their maximum reward amount based on the previous year's statistics and savings on remedial services, and it's game on to see if you can get the max. To really get things cooking, cities can creatively come up with ways to stack unlimited rewards, and have a Citizen of the Year who wins something like a 100% property tax rebate and free utilities.

Would the program be expensive to administrate? There would be no point in doing it if it costs more than paying the po po to spank people for being bad. Upfront costs will largely consist of budget analysis to determine potential savings on city expenses, per capita of participant, in order to make a reward offer that will attract participation. Until it's tried as a pilot program (which has probably been done somewhere in the world, most likely Scandinavia), the city will have to make an investment in trying to get people to participate. Most of it can be automated by creating the site, which would be no more complicated than income-tax software. Cities can certainly pool using the same software platform, which will drop costs of administration. It will require reviewers to verify people's uploads. Many of the rewards could be distributed by ACH to those who pay property tax. If you like this idea, take a minute to find your city's mayor or city council email contact, and send it to them. Wouldn't it be great to see some municipalities start it this year?",benny-the-rennie,1642273791

472,Community Charity App idea....,"Ok, so this morning I'm scrolling through reddit and I see someone who posted a blown out tire with the title ""Down to my last $20, now I have to fix this""

Well for some reason it made me think of an app to help people in desperate times for little things, or potentially more depending on the situation of course.

For example, this guy with the tire. He could submit a request for help and people can either take it on solo, or vote on helping or not. Once the votes hit a certain mark, it's decided whether to help or not.

If it's decided we've agreed on helping someone, the funds are released. Now, of course there's really no way to monitor how the money is spent if it's sent to a person.  Maybe have another option where the community can pay the bill in question directly?

This is probably a stupid idea, but I hate seeing people struggling and I can't help everyone in need. If it were up to me, I would be broke by helping anyone who needs help...The wife would kill me.

I feel like they would fight at first but they'd realize they are alike and they would become friends. Like Rick accidentally goes to the MCU and sees Deadpool

&gt;Deadpool: ""Hey, Doc Brown!""

&gt;Rick: ""Oh no I'm in the Fox marvel universe""

&gt;Deadpool: ""Actually this is the MCU""

*Deadpool tries the szechuan sauce*

&gt;Rick: ""yes it's good""

*Rick explains the history of szechuan sauce*

It might not work immediately but we know that we tend to sink breath and heart beat with someone (or in this case *thing*). I think the important thing for this to work it to tell the people to embrace the pulse rate of the device, which should help reduce rates of nocebo as well rates of negative placebos. (For those unaware of how important it is to reduce this, having placebo or nocebo generally what determines if a surgery will work or not, and  it can be applied to just about anything, hence why I mention this very specific detail here.)",Mundane-Mage,1641855125

634,An Autologous blood storage company that donates your unused blood when you die (or stop donating),"If you're not familiar with this concept, before surgery, sometimes doctors will prescribe an autologous blood donation, which means that you ""donate"" blood which is intended to be used to transfuse back to yourself if needed later (this is the safest form of blood transfusion). There are several benefits to this type of transfusion... Typically, you need a doctors order for it. I'm not 100% sure, but I think any unused blood just gets thrown away after surgery is performed, which sounds like an awful waste to me. Worldwide especially, but even just nationwide (here in the US), we are always in need of blood and blood plasma.

Now imagine a service where instead of needing a doctors order, anyone could just ""donate"" blood, same way you would donate for a service like Red Cross or Vitalint (the new name of what used to be Bonfils), but the blood would get stored for your personal usage in an emergency. So, this would work on a schedule, where you'd agree to show up and have a certain amount always donated on a regular basis, and you'd be guaranteed that ALL of the blood you donate would be available immediately and on demand if you were ever in need of a transfusion for any reason, however, upon your death, or if you ever decide to stop donating, all of your donated blood would be made available for the general need of the medical community.

This way, in the event you need a transfusion, you'd be getting all the benefit of having YOUR OWN blood transfused. There'd be no need to test for donor/recipient blood types, you wouldn't have to worry about getting diseases \[that you didn't already have, anyway\] like hepatitis and hiv, and you'd have a 100% guarantee that your transfusion would not be rejected by your body (because its already your own blood!). This would be a benefit to the medical community because you wouldn't be draining a system that is already strained by lack of supply, and best of all, whenever you DO die, all of your unused donated blood could then be donated into the system to help bolster the supplies needed by the community (hopefully, the world at large). I think a service like this could be made very popular with rich white people who could be lured in with the promise of medical safety, and even more so with people who would be afraid of receiving somebody elses blood. I know that certain religions are against transfusions on the basis that its someone elses blood, I don't know what their standpoint is on receiving their OWN blood, but if you could promise someone for instance, a pregnant woman who is at high risk of birth complications that she'd be transfused with her own bodily fluids and not someone elses, I think that would probably be highly attractive in such a situation.

I personally already donate blood, and encourage others to do the same, but I could be lured with the capacity to store my own blood for my personal use if the need ever arises. It wouldn't be a drain on the system because whenever I die, my blood would still get donated, but this would potentially bolster that system because I think it could attract new people to donate, who otherwise previously might not have had what they considered a ""good enough"" reason.",cyranix,1641822393

685,make a movie that starts off from the 3rd installment of a trilogy series.,"Make a shitty movie where it has all the hallmarks of a 3rd movie cash grab milking every last bit of cash cow.

Like 1 of the cliche is having 1 or 2 of the original cast being replaced by different actors because of fail movie contract negotiations. And then they would talk about it often and joke about how the main character is not really the real hero because the actual big name hollywood actor hero from the 1st film was killed off. 

Another thing is the lowbudget straight to dvd special effect. Like they would make fun of it stating how they initially had more money for the 1st film and they literally blew it on explosive trailers. 

Another joke that has to come up is when actors are asking why are the actors even doing this film, and like the issue of copyright comes up where there needs to be a film made every 5 years or the rights go back to some other owner out of the studio's hands. 

Another joke should be how the writers fucked up the story and ending of the 3rd film like season 8 of Game of Thrones when all they had to so was literally direct the movie just like in the books word for word and it would have been better. 

If the 3rd film succeeded then the next film should be a super prequel which is the 1st movie of the series to further confuse the audience. 

Like the audience be like, so this movie is a prequel? No, it is the prequel to the sequel or second film that has not even been released yet. 

And then they just dont even make the 2nd film to just really confuse the audience because film 1, the super prequel had a bunch of end of credit teaser trailers advertising the 2nd film. 

If the super prequel was a hilarious success then they go straight to a remake/reboot of the 3rd film because it took more than 5 years to make. 

Then make a bunch of short comics to fill in for movie 2 and put a bunch of ads in it advertising about the Remake/Reboot.

734,"To prevent poaching of elephants, let's give the elephants guns.","So, poaching of wild elephants is a perennial problem, even in protected wildlife reserves. Park rangers need to patrol vasts stretches of difficult terrain, all on a very limited budget. The elephants freely wander vast stretches of land, and poachers will inevitably slip through. It's an intractable problem.

The solution, therefore, is to focus on our ultimate objectives in protecting endangered elephants. Which do we care more about, bringing poachers to justice, or stopping poaching all together? And since we can't constantly have guard forces near every elephant at all times, we need an alternate way of protecting them. 

The solution to this problem has been staring us in the face.  Who better to protect the elephants...than the elephants? They are [accomplished tool users.](https://medium.com/elp-rumbles/weapons-ear-cleaners-and-fly-swatters-elephant-tool-use-574ed7a16e48)  and have demonstrated [numerous and diverse examples](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347283711838) of using various simple tools. 

With that in mind, I think the solution should be obvious. Elephants are complex tool users, and there is zero reason they shouldn't be able to operate a suitably designed fire arm. 

Since elephants are famously strong, we could get away with something of significant caliber. I'm thinking a pair of 50 caliber machine guns, mounted to a tilt and turn table positioned on the elephant's back. The targeting system would be controlled with two components. First, elephant would hold a trigger in their mouths that could be activated by lightly biting into it. Whenever the elephant bites down, the guns activate. (This trigger would hang from a tether they can grab when they want to be ready to fire.) Aiming is a bit trickier, but I think that could be done by eye-tracking software. Have a camera monitoring the elephant's eyes. Also have sensors monitoring the position of the elephant's neck. Use software to aim they guns wherever the elephant is looking. 

And boom. Now you've built an elephant-controlled gun. To fire, the elephant just has to look at something and then bite down on the trigger.

So to implement this, first abduct a member of a larger elephant group or family. Capture them and take them to a training location. Harness the elephant up with their gun turret, and train them how to use it. After a few weeks, return them to their group with the gun turret attached. Repeat this procedure as many times as needed until there are no more poachers. 

Now, we do have to worry about safety. We want the elephants to kill poachers, but we don't want them raiding human villages like a pachyderm Attila the Hun.  We'll make the gun platforms remote-controllable. There will be a satellite link in every one of them. And if they ever go more than 24 hours without pinging a sat, the guns automatically shut off. There will also be an encrypted instant shut-off code that can be used to instantly deactivate the weapon once received. Combine those together and we have a system with some robust backups and protections. First, we have protection against a rogue elephant scenario. First, we'll have an instant-off option. It will require just the broadcasting of a closely-guarded security command, and codes can simply be changed after their use. This shut-off command would be implemented by an extremely robust receiver (think five redundant radio receivers. These would be positioned throughout the turret in such a way as to make their simultaneous accidental destruction nearly impossible. The only foreseeable situation where all receivers are destroyed would be if the elephant themselves purposely destroyed them all. And we'll make even this a fail-safe scenario. We'll position the backup receivers in such a way that destroying them by blunt-force impact would also destroy components critical for the guns' activation. But, if all of this somehow fails, the elephant will only have 24 hours before their gun just shuts off. Once we cut the turret off from the satellite's ping, the guns will deactivate themselves after 24 hours. If an elephant goes rogue, we simply cut them off. An elephant can't move very fast, and thus keeping people away from it for 24 hours isn't difficult. We could also use drones to launch tranquilizer darts at the rogue elephant. Either way, the rogue elephant is subdued. Their gun turret is removed, and they're sent home. 

Over time, the elephants, being adaptive tool users, will find all sorts of uses for their new machine gun. They might learn to use their guns to scare off predators. Or, they might learn to use them to shoot down fruit from high tree branches. You might even see them use them on the dominance fights males perform against each other. Over time, they will become part of the culture of an elephant group. It will become normal for an elephant to see own of their other group members has a gun turret. It will just become something most elephants end up doing for some period of their lives. 

Once they're sufficiently acclimatized to these weapons, we might not even need to abduct and train individual elephants. Elephants will simply know what gun turrets are and how to use them by observing other elephants using them. Gun ownership will be something elephants actually seek out. Having a machine gun turret on your back will be a huge elephant status symbol. There would be elephants lining up at the door to be fitted with them. In time, we'll train them to bring their weapons in regularly for servicing. We'll also train them to use automatic turret-reloading stations we position throughout the elephants' range. 

How about scale, how many of these turrets do we need? You should aim to arm maybe 1 in 20, maybe 1 in 10 of the elephants in an area? That seems about right. Maybe 1 in 20. That will be enough to provide a good degree of coverage while still keeping the cost as low as practical. You don't want to have to pay to arm every elephant, but you also want to make sure nearly every elephant group will have at least 1 guard elephant present. 1 in 20 seems about right for that. 

Now that we've discussed safety and scale, there's one final area that should be addressed. The 24 timer means that if you could jam communications in an area, then in 24 hours all the guide elephants will be unarmed. However, this is not a practical solution for poachers. First, they would need to broadcast a jamming signal over a wide area. This is difficult to do without being noticed. Second, they need to do this for a ridiculously long length of time. If an elephant ever went more than a few minutes without pinging the satellite, then teams are sent out to investigate. It's simply not possible for poachers to broadcast such a signal for 24 hours without being noticed. Poachers are armed, but they're not armed at the level of nation-states. And 24 hours is a hell of a long time to bring in heavy reinforcements, regardless of how well poachers might be. Poachers would have to be able to broadcast a jamming signal over a wide area. The source of such a strong broadcast would be trivial to track down. Thus, a poacher jamming signal would have to be sufficiently protected as to counter national armies. That simply doesn't happen unless the national governments in question are so weak as to be completely failed, anarchic states. In any nation where there is even a barely-functioning state, poachers are going to be outgunned by the state. 

And if the state was so incredibly weak that they couldn't fight off poachers? Well in that case, the poachers are likely to simply topple the existing government by their superior force of arms. Poachers with more guns than the national government tend to simply become the new national government. At that point, they start worrying about things that are better for the nation overall, such as protecting native species. Poaching as a whole is almost always overall a net negative to the nations in occurs in. Their GDP gets a small boost from hunting, but the long-term value in ecotourism and scientific research dollars greatly exceeds this. The poaching of an elephant makes money for the poachers, but it is a massive net negative to the host nations. Thus, if the poachers effectively ever become the new government, the poachers turned government will have a strong incentive not to continue hunting. If you own the country, you start caring about things in terms of overall economic impact. Thus, if the poachers were ever so well-armed as to be able to defeat national armies, then those poachers will effectively become the new government. That new government will be strongly incentivized to stop poaching. Thus, if poachers ever overthrow the government, they will quickly converge to the same policies of animal protection as the previous government. 

So, I think that covers all the bases. It should be possible to build a machine gun turret that sits on an elephant's back and is controlled by the elephant. It should also be possible to fit individual elephants with these, and at a sufficient scale to protect nearly all elephants in the wild. We have robust safeguards in place to address rogue elephant scenarios. Jamming could in theory cause the deactivation of all the guard elephants in an area, but that jamming signal would have to be active for 24 hours continuously. That's a hell of a long time to maintain a signal while reinforcements can be brought in. Unless a poaching outfit becomes so powerful they can resist a national army, then poachers can be simply outgunned in this scenario. If they do have enough firepower to resist a national army, then they can simply overturn the national government whenever they wish. At which point, the incentives of running a nation-state will encourage them to adopt wildlife protection policies.",isleepinahammock,1641628048

753,Starting a snowball effect to make every household have their own solar panels,"I came upon this idea while thinking about a guy in Norway that gave all his neighbors free renewable energy, as his solar panels generated more electricity than he was able to use.

So this is what I came up with. What if you bought or built your own solar panels and started selling cheaper electricity than the power companies provide, to multiple households. You only use this rent to cover the operational costs. 

You make a contract that reads something along the lines of: When the money generated by renting out electricity to a household reaches a certain point, when possible, you use that money to get the household their very own solar panels of equal efficiency to yours. 

These households that have now acquired their own solar panels now do the same thing and this process gets repeated over and over again. It would theoretically be possible to create a snowball effect where solar panels effectively take over the world, as everyone who have access to electricity eventually only have to pay their own operational costs. 

If we take this even further, a cultural shift emerges where people begin to learn how to maintain and repair their own electronics, as people have more control and even own the electricity itself, driving our world towards an utopia where recycling electronics at home will be part of life, just another form of housework. Perhaps everywhere in the world, people will have access to electricity in one form or another, except for very isolated indigenous peoples of course. But that's not all, the threat of an AI apocalypse will be less likely as the machines now depend on their household. 

Of course this whole idea relies on whether or not the operational costs can be covered while competing with power companies. Although the thought of eventually having free energy is a great incentive regardless in my opinion. 

While power companies have the power to develop more efficient solar panel technology that may hinder this idea from succeeding, households being able to acquire their own solar panels this way may lower the barrier to entry when it comes to owning solar panels in the first place. It could be seen as a large enough threat to power companies that it could force them to innovate in ways that we haven't seen in decades, making renewable energy much more efficient effectively speeding up the process of forcing nations to abandon other forms of non-renewable energy.

Tl;dr: Aquire solar panels, sell electricity directly to other households, buy them solar panels with all the profits, they do the same, repeat.",SavedByGhosts,1641603026

Our Next Arc is a Union of Businesses whose upper echelon codify morality into their actions by willfully accepting a Maximum Wage of 300k, then reinvesting all profits above 300k to raise the minimum wage to $25, increase benefits, and fund other ONA businesses.

We follow 3 principles:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_

1) **Maximum Wage $300k**$300k USD Maximum Wage for all positions in the business. Adjusted fairly for inflation. All Salaries are transparent. Profits over $300k must be reinvested back to the company to increase employee wages, benefits, and to fund other ONA businesses. Limiting the upper echelon wages ensures no single entity becomes excessively wealthy while others suffer, all while still greatly rewarding those who reach the maximum wage limit. No financial schemes like hiding wages in stocks. Employees are free to buy and invest stock as they would in any company they believe in. We operate with willful and purposeful transparency.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

2) **Increase Employee Wages, Benefits, and Work-Life Balance**$25 Hourly Minimum Wage adjusted fairly for inflation. All the resources saved by the Maximum Wage are directly invested back to employees and the company.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

3) **Separation of Business and Government**We pay our taxes, not our politicians. Our businesses willfully pay their taxes in full to ensure our governments are properly funded to deliver basic human rights and we will collaborate lawfully and transparently within our governments directly for these basic rights.

783,"Big Father, the government mass surveillance program we need","In America, one in five people live with a mental illness. Id assume only a small portion of these people receive any psychiatric treatment through their lives.

Here’s my idea to help with this

The government should put everyone under surveillance and use algorithms to give them treatments. (Call it Big father… no one needs big brother telling us what to do, but everyone could use a father figure)

First they would need to figure out who’s got what going on in that ol noggin of theirs. By analyzing a persons data (internet history, email, texts with loved ones etc) they should be able to pinpoint what sort of psychological issues an individual may have. 
Reddit for example would give an insane amount of data for this. Just imagine what someone could assume about you just by looking into the posts and comments you make on here. I’m sure if you have a list large enough of subreddits a user follows and interacts with it would be a breeze to clearly understanding their personality type and mental state. Add
on the insane amount of information we put into our phones on a daily basis to this and you would basically have what Facebooks algorithm does with its users but on steroids.

So now you have all this information, what do we do with it?

Imagine if “Big Father” could pick up on a fight being had through texting between two individuals and could deduce that the person it’s realized has one of the ten personality disorders(BPD, narcissist,antisocial etc) is the aggressor. It could then enable a set of circumstances that could help the person slowly understand how to better deal with those situations. And possible even help the other person better deal with someone with these problems.

I don’t really have that many ways this can be done yet except for subliminal messages through social media post. The person would get more posts curated for their situation type. Things like you’d see on Life pro tips, more self awareness posts, and maybe ways to cope with whatever may be going on in their life.

The algorithm wouldn’t have to be used solely on sick people. It can be used for almost anything in society like helping people get jobs (lower the unemployment / under employment rate), encouraging people get a higher education, be better at parenting, and even little things like teaching people with bad driving records how to be better on the road. Honestly the list could go on and on…. 

Whatever society needs, Big Father can help with it.",Pretty_Midnight6176,1641533677

What if the police could use gas grenades that instead of teargas would emit a mist of spike molecules? Since the virus usually reaches the body through the air, why can't we do the same with parts of the virus? It would have the following benefits:

* It would primarily target people who are not yet vaccinated
* People might feel too sick to protest the next day
* If the word gets out that they might catch a vaccination, some people might stop protesting",SoundAndSmoke,1641472006

Have intercourse without the fear of making others pregnant.

No need for women consuming pills to avoid pregnancy which have a lot of negative effects.
No need of men worrying that a women would come down with with a child claiming to be yours.

Why men? Well sperm are created in millions in men and taking them out is not a painful/bloody act AFAIK.

836,Nature-destiny charts - A way to plot future events,"Basically my idea (revealed to me by a dream) is that you can plot eventual circumstances (not when they will occur but if they will occur). Through the use of mass psychology (everyone taking a certain path through life with higher probability of them taking a certain path) and knowledge of human nature.  


So it would look something like this.  


|---- Car 2  30% ---- |   

Point A ---- Bus 1 50%  ---- Point B

|---- Bike 3 20% ----|  


1 : Some made up study says people are most likely to take a bus there  
2 : Some made up study says people are fairly likely to take a car there  
3 : Some made up study says people are least likely to ride a bike there  


So we can draw the conclusion that we will need to spend very much on public transit, or something to that effect. This is a poor example though. It real shines with future events. Like for example I made one that predicts that robots will be misused by 10% of the population with criminal tendencies.

They use food items found in food pantries and TRY to make a nice healthy meal. They use food from a different food pantry from different cities and states each day. We are talking like professional chefs who usually work high end restaurants. Then the finial round per episode is the high end chef facing off with average joe who knows what it’s like making decent meals from your basic of basic foods. But thing is they have to use a basic kitchen one you would find in your small house or apartment. Not like the ones you’d see in Hells Kitchen or something. Some of the profits would go to the food pantry they use that episode.

To finish the virus off once and for all.

2 weeks off for us all. Globally. Starting 1/3/2022. We will all be available for work again on the 17th.

2. **We need to come together as a unit on this.** Anyone speaking about refusing to work with other groups/individuals because they won't simply assimilate into your own group needs to be kept in check. This is a collective effort. Division is our weakness. Find what is similar in others, what unites you and makes your similar, and link firmly through that.
3. **This isn't about you or any one of us.** Anyone vying for self-serving power right now needs to be kept in check. This is a collective effort. Take any great ideas you see and implement them with others who are helpful and collaborative.

2) Subtract from #1 the amount I'd pay with the help of a job or friends/family/scholarships, etc. while I am there.

3) Calculate my expected post-graduation earnings for each major and university. This is a simple formula: How much you'd be expected to make in a career field related to your major, multiplied by the probability you're hired. As far as I know, you can look up what percentage of graduates at a given university gets a job in their major, and use that statistic in your calculation.

Or likewise, I am afraid that the jewelry store's online database might be hacked and publicly exposed, and then *everyone* can see that I ordered a $10,000 necklace along with the address they can come to rob me.

Package carriers should create an option where you sign up with them and give the carrier your address. In return, they give you an anonymized token (basically a random code) that links with your address *but only in the carrier's database.*

Then, when you order something, you can give this code to the seller, which will be printed on the package. And as soon as it reaches the first mail center, they will scan it, fetch the actual address from the database, and print a new label over top, and then the mail continues as normal throughout the system.

Tada, you've accomplished purchasing something online without the seller ever knowing your address. And you didn't have to trust some 3rd party ""re-shipping"" company with your package either.

1053,Walmart battle plan??,"Yo this sounds stupid and possibly crazy, but hear me out. . .

Walmart has an extensive and MASSIVE amount of real estate. Their trying to catch up to Amazon, in the e-commerce space, with varying degrees of success. What if Walmart instead, tries to catch up to Amazon by making their own version of AWS, but not for tech?

Heres the thing. If you have a coffee shop, that suddenly starts doing good, you would want to scale up your business right? Normally that would be mean going through the effort of buying new locations and training new employees and shit, while creating supply chains and stuff for each location.

What if we took some of the generic repeatable steps of that process, and have a third party handle it and help us scale up? 

What if the Coffee Shop wants data analysts? what if they want consulting for management? Small business right now doesn't have all the tooling and services that a big corporation has. What if Walmart could be pro-small business, by providing all the tooling and services to small businesses, whenever they need it? Similar to how AWS would give you the computational resources on demand, whenever you need to scale up.

WeWork has questionable business practices, but I think they do have a cool idea though, in the fact that they help people scale up their business by providing office space whenever they need it. I feel like we can apply that concept to other avenues too.

One criticism people might have of the idea is the fact that you can already hire freelancers and all these people for a single project, and they don't gotta be permanent employees. The response is i guess organization. 

The response is, Small Business's usually dont have people with whole degrees and shit working, and in turn, dont know what they exactly Need, or how to get it. The Solution would be a hybrid of both a website, and face to face consulting, alot like what Palantir does. 

This prolly is a dumb idea, but its probably the right subreddit for dumb ideas lol. I genuinely wonder if people have done this stuff before. Uniting all these third party business services under a singular entity. 

Sorry for the unstructured rambling too lol.

1093,Doctors should not be allowed to charge if they can't fix your problem,"Example: you go to the doctor bc your ears feel stuffed up. They look in your ears, etc, can't find a cause or give you a cure. NO FRICKIN CHARGE. If they are unable to diagnose, why should I fund that? If my mechanic can't find a problem with my car, he can't charge me. Why should the doctor be any different? I don't go to the doctor to wait around for them to run their office an hour late - I go there for an ailment to be cured. They overuse referrals to specialists and charge for office visits where they do absolutely nothing, including not forwarding their findings to the specialist, so you have to go through intake and initial exam all over again. Additionally, the practice of doctors' offices keeping you waiting hours past your appointment time needs to end. I have tested this by booking several appointments with different providers (who are only at that practice - not coming from hospital rounds) at the first time slot of the day. The least time I have been kept waiting has been 45 minutes, meaning they can't be arsed to open up their office and start work on time bc they know their customers are used to waiting.

Here's how it needs to go. You make your appointment online and do complete intake paperwork, including a description of your complaint. They ACTUALLY REVIEW your intake, call you with any questions, and if CURING your issue is not on their list of codes, they pre-arrange with a specialist and FORWARD your complete intake, with all notes, saving everyone the time so they can run their office on time. Understandably, they may not know whether they can help you until they examine you, but if they can't, they should not charge for an office visit that is nothing more than pushing paperwork, and no diagnosis or treatment is performed. If, however, the doctor can get you an answer by researching or consulting with someone and getting back to you, she has something to bill for. I have had two family doctors who did this, saying it was something they would need to know. Unproductive office visits amount to patients paying for doctors to not expand their knowledge base. How to change the system when medical practices have you by the balls - review sites need to include review points of ""did the doctor resolve your medical issue"" and ""how long did you wait after your appointment time.""",benny-the-rennie,1640808226

1101,Artificial muscles for robotics using shape memory alloys,"Electrical engineers and robotics folks, tell me why this won’t work so I can stop thinking about it. 

The idea is to emulate the structure of actual muscles/muscle fibers using a series of segmented shape memory wires which shorten when exposed to electrical charge. Each fiber consists of many short lengths which can be charged/shocked independently depending on the desired shortening of the muscle. These would be bundled to mimic actual human muscles and attached to a “bone”, a metal core of some kind, to be used in robotics or exoskeletons. (The bone in the case of exoskeletons would be a housing/armor around the human body part). 

The second part of this is the use of devices used for human motor decoding from neural signals (like the ones being experimented with in prosthetics) to control the artificial fibers. Electrodes attached to the skin to detect neural signals, a decoder attached to the electrodes, and an amplifier attached to decoder to send the actual charge to the “fibers”.

My inexperience in electrical engineering is probably overlooking something obvious. I assume this comes down to inefficient energy consumption and the work/time required to restore shape memory wires to their original form.

Capcom and Star Wars has the newly announced Star Wars: Hunters). And yes there are characters in Disney movies that I think would suit a fighting game that aren't just ""animals being heavies a la Donkey Kong"" (though of the animals I can think of multiple Jungle Book characters that'd work) e.g. Merida and Mulan are obvious roster includes, I've been saying Elsa would suit Smash (and therefore would suit a Smash-alike) since Fighters Pass 2 came out, and even the newest movie *Encanto* could have some reps despite the heroine's lack of powers as Luisa and Isabela have fighting-game-worthy Gifts (the former would be your typical ""heavy"" fighter (I don't think any Smash-esque game has ever really had a female heavy so that'd be breaking new ground) while the latter would be more of a Zelda-esque character like Elsa would be). And that's just the movies as while it'd be too weird to have someone from the live-action shows there's plenty of potential fighters from the cartoons like Luz from The Owl House (each of her specials etc. could be taken from a different coven's discipline of magic) or Phineas from Phineas And Ferb (who'd be a ""gimmick fighter"" like Villager/Isabelle) or less recent characters like Kim and Shego from Kim Possible or the eponymous American Dragon: Jake Long.

And a ""Disney Smash"" would also lend itself to some really cool stage locations like Ahtohallan or the Beast's castle or some sort of multiple-phase Mulan thing where you're fighting everywhere from the mountains (perhaps with an avalanche hazard) to the rooftops and just imagine the music (sure some of it might be kinda inappropriate for a fighting game even if it's all instrumental but how would fighting to something like Part Of Your World be any less jarring than the more mellow Smash tracks like Brewster's Roost or Swan Lesson). And new fighters coming from new movies or shows would be announced with the thing while new post-launch ones from old properties would be announced like a Smash one would be.

Now the question is, would multiverse shenanigans require Sora to be playable in this too with his Smash moveset (or as close as it'd translate with a potentially different setup) and what would that mean for both multiverses' future connections?",StarChild413,1640746044

3.) April 1st is much nicer for a New Years celebration.   No more standing outside in the cold to watch fireworks.  Enjoy a nice balmy evening instead.

1196,Idea for crypto based communities. A place where one can work or be part of a virtual nation.," 

So basically I have been thinking about what is wrong with current economy. Mostly it is that nations are burdened with old systems. Bureaucracy, paperwork and so forth.

The idea of virtual nationhood is something I came up with back in nineties when I felt I was ""Virtual American."". I am Finnish but through the internet I mainly interacted with Americans / followed American news / topics. Eventually it even led to me being married to American gal for 16 years.

Now when you add crypto to this all. Which I dabbled with myself, creating a testnet crypto at one point. I realize one could combine this all.

In games we sort of have this. Games have their own economy, their own world. But what if these ideas were combined.

I know people do this already. But when you combine all of the above. You could make a crypto based app where you belong to a say, ""Siliconistan"". A virtual nation of computer freaks. These people would talk with each other through the app, possibly follow their own news, united by common hashtags they follow, they would do business together.

In a way it would bring back the trading quarters of medieval cities. Like, clothing designers world wide could all belong to the same ""nation"". Where they would once again follow their own news etc. It would not matter where they are, they could talk, do business with each other. The real nationhood that would keep them from mingling would drop off and they would interact with each other in a way where their locality would not matter.

This would be a strength because since they would be from all over, they could instantly start working together world wide.

Say, someone had a idea for a new app. They would meet in some sort of meta place. There would be a gathering of 100 likeminded people. They would talk about the details. There would be a vote for what kind of company they would create to make this new app, the people would vote for creation of the company. As they would a new crypto would be created, standing for shares in the company.

Now the company would be virtually created. Instantly. The people would hold meetings, start planning on building the product, there would be team leaders, coders, marketers, salesmen chosen. All this virtually, in moments after the initial meeting.

Something that old economy could not make happen in a long while.

The problem of course being that such a virtual entity would not be protected by laws. But then it would be up to the design of the crypto currencies in the heart of the app that would do revenue sharing. Ie. The fair share would be built in. The currency coming in from the new company would simply be divided automatically between the shares somehow. This would be down to programming.

Also, you could just earn crypto by simply working for the newly created company.

Of course it would be hard to avoid a situation where a lot of people would flood in and claim shares in all new companies. But maybe a way around that would be that the person / people with the idea could vet people who they would let in to their venture. Possibly they could set a price for the shares of the new company? The company would be a NFT of sorts. Its initial creation a meeting where the amount of shares amongst the creators would be agreed to.

Basically it would all revolve around crypto. Every person, every company, every transaction, every meeting, every virtual property would be on the blockchain. It would be the meta Zuckeberg is talking about. But it would not be Facebook. It would not be centrally governed, but democratically, through votes.

I understand that meanwhile people want to live in the ""Real world"". But we already own crypto currencies and trade with them, this would be just another step in that direction. A shadow nationhood.

You could live in China or US, but identify as a citizen of your virtual nationhood more than by your real one.

There could be different interfaces to the underlaying p2p blockchain network but it all would hinge on the creation of the bitcoin like layer which all this could be built on top of.

I know people already sort of do this in games. But this would be no game. People who would sit down to create a joint venture would actually work for the company in real lives and earn bitcoin from the work they do, which would be channeled on to their crypto wallets and earn income which they would pay taxes for.

You could literally surf for work now and be employed ten minutes later. It would be ""Walk in's welcome"" on steroids, also leveling the playing field world wide because if you could do something. It would not matter where you are from.

The real nationhood / virtual nationhood would surely clash both legally and in other ways. But Rome was not created in a day.",Mrloop,1640581058

Many don't know anyone who has died of COVID and when they do the deaths are very sanitized. Hospitals hide the bodies away in a morgue until they get cremated or whatever. my solution is simple. all covid dead should be dumped in public places where people see the bodies. the bodies will be left to rot and stink up the place. it would be illegal to move the bodies after they have been placed. antivaxers will get bodies delivered to their front doors like packages. 800k corpses left in strategic places around the country will help people understand death and therefore take public health seriously.

1230,World history book series where one seemingly small event is changed and it completely changes the world after.,"after a reminder of a car crash that happened around 1977 that could have changed not only pop culture, by film making and special effects and the course of science for so many young people inspired by a franchise... I got thinking about how seemingly simple things could utterly alter the world. And I'd be very curious to see a series of mock history books where the smallest things had to happen just right for the world to be what it is today. 

Like write a history of the 1990s and early 2000s where so much would be different that you would have to be given hints that it goes back to the fact that there isn't one ""the Internet"" but many differing internets that are patented and proprietary systems incompatible with each other because Tim Berners-Lee went a different route with the internet idea due to something coming up that made the money he could gain, a better option for him at that moment.

How does that effect the online world, how does that effect things like smart phones and movie companies and streaming services. what changes in hardware if the information age. How does that effect the rise of things like Amazon, and social media. Paypal and ultimately fortunes of Musk  and Bezos. The Private companies racing to space. Twitter, election meddling by smear campaigns. The massive confirmation bias bubbles we all fall into. How does it change the course of Covid if things like this were changed.

All because of a surprise bill making it easier for Tim Berners-Lee to see the money route as a better option than a free and open internet using the same standards all around.

and now imagine a dozen other worlds changed by seemingly simple small things that are easy to mis how pivitol they are.",doinwhatIken,1640502231

1384,"An idea about how to achieve telekinesis, obverse the 4th dimension, and","Imagine a stick figure, circle head, you know. Now let's say he is a 3-D model where there is a sphere with little cylinder torso, arms, and legs. little 3D stick figure man can walk around , think, turn, speak, but he can only see what is *directly* on the same plane as him.

Do you know about the 'flatland' idea, of little triangle and square who live in a stick figure world doing stuff and what not? It's pretty fun.

Let's take a utlra-thin perfectly flat 'slice' of the 3-D man's view and imagine it from above, we would have a circle which moves around and interacts with other things.

What I am getting at here is to imagine yourself as that 3d man living in a 2d world. If you can think of 'everything about something all at once' including how it acts beyond the physical view and beyond what it's made of at that time, then you can imagine something beyond our plane. 
The idea that if you can come in contact with 4D beings or objects that instead of 'seeing with your eyes' you can observe with you mind.
If then you can learn to use the whole you beyond what's in your head you can use your legs to move youself around in the world with greator vigor like high motivation. People walk without thinking, some can't walk as well or at all, learning to run is like nature speed.

But your you, is only the brain the the stick figure's head. You have to learn to use the arms attached to you, not in a physical way",cinnamintdown,1640145582

1388,"We should have a USPS delivery pipeline system throughout every post office in the country (if not continent), kinda like water or oil lines.","Think about it like this: Someone could ship their package/mail from New York, drop/ship it at their local post office, and then the postal worker can simply send it through a nationwide (or continent-wide) pipeline system of some sort where the included label code will automatically determine its destination throughout the system. It then can stop at, say, a small town’s post office in South Carolina and ship like normal to its destination. It’s like a subway but for mail, or maybe even those cool suction pipes at bank drive-thrus. Maybe the pipes or tunnels can be big enough to support an average big package and perhaps a few people so it can accommodate for any needed repairs rather than having a whole crew dig it up. Kinda like a sewer system! 

This means that not only could shipping be more efficient, but it could possibly eliminate the need for cross country trucks beyond maybe super big packages (therefore cutting emissions), lessen package damage, make shipping go quicker, and possibly even lower shipping costs in the long run. 

The only issue I could think of regarding this (beyond the obvious initial budget issues and what not) would be the elimination of jobs like cross country deliveries. However, let’s say we still pay ex-deliverers and other people, say, by the mile/kilometer ([I’ve actually shared this idea here before!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/rb32jc/a_system_where_companies_will_be_enforced_to/) Some people mentioned its imperfections, but let’s say it went as planned). Deliverers will still be supported without the painstaking work and high emissions. Then, on days when a part of the pipeline is in need to repair, they can either pay someone else to fix it or even fix it themselves if one of them happened to be nearby.

This reflects in the general coldness of the day as well. There could be a drop in sexy noun costumes (a blessing or a curse depending on who you ask) but the cold could be an excuse to wear elaborate costumes that would keep us warm.



Christmas on the other hand could be October 31st, as a reminder to keep God's warmth and light close to us as we are tried by the cold dark winter. Giving new clothes and things before it's already cold and we already need them.

1429,There needs to be a live action Among Us film. Hear me out.,"Now I know, this could easily just end up being forgettable, but it could be pretty fun.

The film should be mystery themed. Make it hard to predict who the imposter will be until nearing the end.

The entire film needs to take place inside the classic space ship with props that take inspiration from the game’s space ship decor. Imagine how fun it’d be if [this area](https://imgur.com/gallery/p7rdR3N) was recreated into live action. Imagine the machine in Med Bay!

I cannot stress this enough: everyone needs to be wearing a space suit that is their own color. The closest example I can think of is the pink suits from Squid Game but the masks are pitch black glass and each suit has its own color. **No one should ever take off their masks. This is crucial.** If an actor is not okay with getting any face time, kick them out of production. The only humanization required for the spacemen is the colors they represent, though they could perhaps have some unique defining personalities. **It should go without saying that everyone should refer to one another by their color.** No real names like John or Sarah. This is all necessary to preserve the spirit of the game.

When an emergency meeting is called, everyone should gather around an oval table and discuss what they saw. **Their voices should sound like the astronauts from the Apollo moon landing.** Imagine that kind of voice saying something like, “Blue, I saw you near Pink in Nav before they died. Care to tell us what you were doing?” You cannot tell me it wouldn’t at least be amusing. Imagine the tension when the audience knows it’s most likely Red but the final vote to eject comes down to one person who ends up passing and tying the vote. Imagine what kind of CGI they could use when the imposter kills someone.

The thing is, like I mentioned above, I have lived with my dad and mom for a long time, and now we will live in different houses, which creates a big void in my heart. I always remember in the past, whenever I went home from school, I will see my dad sitting on the sofa watching TV, and my mom preparing my dinner. Nothing extraordinary, but it makes me feel like home is a place where people will return.

Unlike western countries, where children usually decide to move out of their parents house when they grow up, Asians like me want to live in a big house with many family members, like mom and dad, siblings, aunt, uncle, grandparents, etc...and it's not like I want to live with them because I'm unemployed and I can live by using their money. No, all I want is someone to welcome to after I return home from work.

My cousin is living with her husband, her mother (her father already passed away), and her 3 children in a small apartment. By now, I do want to move in with them. I don't want to get marriage because I don't want responsibility, but I do want whenever I go home from work, there will be people to welcome me.

1455,Make hyper-geniuses with brain-computer interface technology,"How could we do that, you might ask? Well, by boosting short-term/working memory with RAM / computer memory technology (if that's even physically possible, which I sincerely hope it is). While our long-term memory capacity is pretty impressive (even if the brain does cheat by using what is in essence a very effective/clever but very lossy compression scheme), our working memory sucks HARD - in fact, I'd go so far as to say it is possibly the _absolute worst_ limitation of the human brain. Studies have shown that one of the primary determinants of intelligence is working memory, and most people are only able to hold around seven digits in their heads (read: around 23 bits, if I've done my math right... gall darn it, my working memory SUCKS!) at once without techniques like chunking (and even then, you're maybe looking at a maximum of maaaaaybe 80-100 bits worth of numeric data for a normal person with some skill)... the comparison may be more favorable with other data types (read: non-numeric information) but still - I wouldn't expect a natural human could store much more than a few kilobytes worth of data in working memory at once, even under ideal circumstances (read: best choice of data type).

In theory if you had gigabytes of working memory that could potentially make you a hyper-genius (at least in some contexts); assuming (very generously) that the best (non-savant, ofc lol) natural humans can store... oh, idk, let's say 1KB of numbers in working memory, and assuming (perhaps optimistically, perhaps pessimistically) you could interface the human brain to 8GB of RAM, the modified human would be able to effortlessly hold 64,000,000X as much numeric data in working memory as the unmodified one - likely without forgetting a single digit for hours, days, or even months on end.

Or, to use another example, assuming you could directly work with Kindle-formatted books in memory (in reality, you'd probably use plaintext files, which are much more space efficient), on average you could hold about 3076 books in your 8GB of augmented working memory - probably for as long as you want. The average person can hold about 7 words in their natural working memory, and is liable to forget them in mere seconds if they're not intensely focused.

To put it simply, this technology (if it's possible and if we develop it) has the potential to turn even someone with below-average intelligence into a _bona fide_ superintelligence - at least for some tasks. Even more tasks if we could somehow integrate a CPU into the human brain as a sort of coprocessor too.

AFAIK this is all in the realm of science fiction right now (to my knowledge, we don't have anything like the kind of sophisticated neural interface tech we'd need to implement this), but it might not have to be. I would argue this should be one of the world's #1 research priorities, since it has the potential to create a _human_ intelligence explosion - by which I mean, exponentially increasing human intelligence, since smarter people should be able to develop better technologies to make us even smarter, which should enable us to develop better technologies to make us even smarter ... and so on and so forth _ad infinitum_ (well, until we hit some kind of fundamental limit, if there is one).

Think about this - if people were even twice as intelligent as we are today, wouldn't that enable us to solve problems like climate change, economics, etc a lot faster? Well, this is an idea that has the potential to make people _millions_ or _billions_ of times more intelligent; those problems might become child's play to solve. I, for one, would _definitely_ be open to being a test subject for that - hell, not just open to it, I'd sign up immediately if I could (as long as the project was _verifiably_ legit and not a scam, LOL).",_re_cursion_,1639977272

1559,"Today is Farch 1st. Happy Farch, everyone.","The Farch Calendar
• All months are 30 days.
• Weeks are 6 days (bye, Tuesday).
• All 30-day months break evenly into 5 weeks.
• A year is 60 weeks.
• 60 weeks of 6 days = 12 months of 30 days = 360 days. The leftover days at the end of the year go into an extra mini-month called Farch.
• Our schedules are simpler to split up and our time is easier to manage. Weeks of the year can be divided like minutes of the hour; great for schools, team projects, salaries.
• Farch is 5 days long. The extra day in a leap year gets tacked onto every fourth Farch, making a leap Farch 6 days long.
• No one works on Farch, if they can avoid it. It’s time outside the normal year to slow down and do nothing. And no more Christmas bonuses. You get a Farch bonus.
• With months dividing evenly into weeks, every month starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday.
• Not Farch, though. Farch is all Saturdays. The alternative is to skip Farch’s Saturday on non-leap years to keep the weekdays in sync, but it’s better to make Farch all Saturdays because then Farch is all Saturdays.
• By keeping the months in sync with weekdays, floating holidays become locked to dates. For example, on the Farch calendar, Thanksgiving always falls on November 22nd. US Election Day is always November 3rd.
• The year ends on the solstice; December 21st on our calendar, which becomes the last day of Farch, so the days stop getting shorter on New Year’s Eve and start getting longer on January 1st.
• Oh, and while we’re at it, no more Daylight Saving.
• This system was used by the ancient Egyptians 6000 years ago. They called their 5-day intercalary month “The Five Upon the Year,” which, when written in hieroglyphs, looks a bit like Farch.",OgreBuzzard,1639762093

Fossil fuels kill more people every 3 days than Chernobyl, and reactor designs exist now that are practically immune to meltdown (reactor design at Chernobyl, RBMK, was very unsafe with a positive void coefficient making it very prone to runaway reactions and meltdown since generating steam due to overheating = more reaction rate = more overheating - ALL modern reactor designs have negative void coefficient, meaning if they start overheating the reaction rate slows = less heat so they sort of self regulate a bit).

https://www.statista.com/statistics/494425/death-rate-worldwide-by-energy-source/

Fossil fuels kill 8,000,000/yr; 8,000,000/365 = 21918 deaths EVERY DAY from fossil fuels (Source: Harvard and ScienceDirect, see above; more available upon request). Worst estimate of Chernobyl given was 60,000, and THAT only happened ONCE. Considering we have reactor designs now that should be completely immune to meltdown (and the RBMK at Chernobyl was a horribly unsafe design with a positive temperature coefficient making it prone to runaway reactions - modern reactors do not have this problem, espc new tech like molten salt, gas cooled, etc) nuclear is looking REALLY good.

Add to that how coal plants emit more radiation into the environment (via the AIR, so it spreads uncontrollably) than a nuclear plant - WAY more, in fact - and the fact that nuclear waste can be buried kilometers underground in deep geologic repositories where it will safely decay away and never come back up (will eventually be reabsorbed into the mantle, which is full of radioactive elements already - that's how the interior of Earth gets a lot of its its heat... so yes, in a sense geothermal is also nuclear) and you have yourself a very safe and sustainable form of energy. Especially if we work on developing thorium reactors on the side - there's enough thorium on earth to power our civilisation for tens of thousands of years - it's basically the silver bullet for the energy crisis. If we redirected fossil fuel subsidies into nuclear energy instead, we'd solve our climate change problem and make the world a better place... the 50s dream of energy being ""too cheap to meter"" might even become a reality. And better fission technology may even help with fusion research through advances in related materials science etc, which would truly be a PERMANENT (like billions of years at least) solution to our energy woes! Nuclear is so good, with a little work it could easily make fossil fuels completely obsolete as an energy source... and therein, I think, lies the problem.

The fossil fuel industry has tried to suppress nuclear with **LIES** fear, uncertainty, and doubt for decades, because they know it's the only thing that can really kill off their entire business model and make them obsolete; the fossil fuel industry loves renewables because it knows then it'll still be able to sell natural gas for peaker plants, but they HATE nuclear because you don't need peaker plants or fossil fuels at all if you've got nuclear energy.",_re_cursion_,1639702027

1600,Make Presidential Terms 12 years with strict goals,"NB: I am not a US citizen nor a resident but as a result of having US news force fed down our throats, I know a bit about it. 
This idea would be more US centric but could be applied to other regions as well with some modifications. 

Instead of having presidential terms be four years long, and alternative would be ten years but with various checkpoints for the attainment of goals. So essentially, every 2 years, goals of yours would be checked to see if they have been attained (not so sure on what the checkpoint years would be, this is just a concept). To prevent partisan fighting this will have an open audit. (do not know the best way, perhaps the block chain could be used here, this would also of course require more transparency with statistics and collection methodologies.) 

To demonstrate, I will use the 2016 election as an example. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would have outlined various goals that they wish to achieve and a date which they wish to achieve it by. So let’s say Donald Trump would promise to cut unemployment by 70% by year 6. This promise would be locked in and if this is not attained, an election will be called (we shall call this a knockout election). The candidate is not automatically removed from office, they are merely eligible to be knocked out from another candidate from their own party or one of the opposing parties. However if the various goals outlined by the candidate are met, they would never be eligible for Knock-out elections and would leave at the end of the 12 year term. They would have to outline what they are going to achieve for each two year interval. 

The reasoning behind the structure would be a couple of reasons. It would force candidates to set a realistic goals and objectives for their presidency. People will also not be fed a bunch of idealistic garbage or be misled by pipe dreams. (Such as building a wall and making Mexico pay for the entirety of the project or raising the federal minimum wage to $20 as espoused by the Squad). It would also essentially force the candidates to bid against each other’s realistic maximum (they cannot for instance go to 90% as they would be held to this so would settle with what an economist deems to be more realistic IE: 40% unemployment reduction). It would also force them to consult with experts such as economists, law makers, health professionals, law enforcement etc. 

The only issue I have in my concept is how to prevent partisan interference. Let’s take the scenario where Donald Trump won the 2016 election, how do you prevent the Democratic Party from blocking every single thing his administration does in order to make him vulnerable to a knockout election or vice versa where Hillary won. 

The only thing I could come to would be for a judge to fine members for being deliberately obtuse where say a measure would benefit the blocking members constituents. 

Another issue would preventing corruption or partisanship with the measuring system to determine whether the person has attainted their goal and that’s if they are eligible for a knock out election. 

Apologies for any grammar mistakes or spelling as I have posted this from my phone. 

Feel free to add suggestions below.

1653,A game that actively helps you to use it as a reward for healthy behaviors/habits,"Basically, I developed a few good habits with the help of ""*artificial rewards*"", like ""*1 hour of GTA V*"" as a reward for ""*1 hour of cardio*"" until the activity itself became rewarding (exercising became fun, in this example).

**However**, since games have their own reinforcement schemes, sometimes a timer on my phone just didn't do the job, because just my ""raw motivation"" wasn't enough for quitting the game in the middle of a mission. Besides, all I had to do was press ""stop"" on my phone and keep playing it. But, if the game was to automatically pause after the designated time and quit to the main menu, it would be a different story.

Also, time flies when we're playing and I could easily fuck up my whole sleep schedule by staying up late playing, but imagine if I tried to play the game and it just said ""*Sorry, this game is not available from 11pm to 6am*"". These are just the examples that immediately popped into my mind, but the possibilities are endless, you could choose between a time frame *('X minutes of playing'*) and/or number of missions/stages played ('*X behavior unlocks Y number of missions*'), lock a whole part of the map until you do bigger tasks/chores or the game could have some kind of ""*slack trigger*"" if you didn't do the task but wants to play anyway, something that leads to decreased enjoyment of the game (you have to play with no sound/the game becomes *too easy* for you to be engaged/a different outcome for a completed mission/you get less points, money or health than usual).

This concept came to my mind while thinking about my own experience, because it's usually not a good idea to rely on sheer willpower when you're developing a new habit. I'm also not a fan of ""gamifying"" these habits, because for me, the activity loses a lot of its appeal once the ""gamifying aspect"" can't be present. 

I would prefer for the game itself to have nothing to do with self-improvement, but inserting a ""*productivity manager*"" option would change the whole experience. Also, needless to say, but the whole thing should be *optional*, of course.",henry_paprika,1639531052

1686,Weird Al would be the best choice for President of the United States and America should start a 50 state write in campaign.,"The more I think about this, the less crazy it gets. I don’t know what Weird Al’s politics are and frankly it doesn’t matter. 

A) Everyone loves Weird Al. The only person ever mad at him was Coolio and even he wasn’t mad very long. 
B) Weird Al will quickly tell you he isn’t qualified to be President. Good. I’m tired of people who aren’t actually competent convinced of their own competence. Weird Al has no lust for power and would never consider running for President. We have to draft him. 
C) The best leaders are good communicators. Weird Al could parody a Lil Nas X song about a carbon tax initiative and it would be catchy enough for it to really resonate with everyone. There are limitless possibilities here. 
D) the US desperately needs someone to help us feel good about ourselves. Weird Al, aside from being an actually incredible musician, is an equally incredible human being. Weird Al would make us feel like we’re all doing the best we can under the circumstances. 

There are so many more. The longer I think about President Weird Al, the more I’m convinced he’s the only hope we have.",SpiderSchwein,1639443821

I also think it would be even funnier if the “unqualified” get the job done and done well without any experience. 
There would be complications to work out but man I would watch weekly updates on something like that.  Maybe it would lower the degree stigma or maybe it would make it worse. 
It wouldn’t have to stop at building stuff but that seems to be one of the more entertaining things.

1763,"Me and my friends created this game and have been playing it for a while. We call it ""Squingball"""," 

Hi  all. Me and my friends created this game a few years ago, and have been  playing it regularly since. It's absolutely a blast, so I decided I  should share it with you all here!

The rules are as follows:

## The game

&amp;#x200B;

* Normal  play consists of two teams of 11 players on field (one on offence (the  ""enemies"") the other on defence (the ""good guys"")) competing during four  15 minute quarters.
* There are usually three ‘time-outs’ per half for each team, with a 12 minutes half-time interval.
* The  purpose of the game is to move the ball into the opposition's ""Tall  Goal"" zone, either by running with the ball until Destroyed, or by  passing the ball to a teammate downfield, towards the Tall Goal zone.
* The key player on each side is the Gruntgrabber who attempts to dictate play.

## Hookdies

&amp;#x200B;

* The team in possession of the ball (enemies) needs to move the ball forward by at least 10 yards while they are on offense.
* They  have four chances, or ""hookdies"", to gain those 10 yards and if they  advance the ball that far, the count resets and the team earns another  set of four hookdies to try go a further 10 yards.
* If  the enemies fail to move these 10 yards within four hookdies,  possession is then given up and the good guys get their turn to play as  the enemies. Teams will usually kick for a tall goal (a large net at  either end of the field) or downfield to the good guys on the fourth  hookdie to try and salvage some points before they lose possession.

## Scoring in Squingball

&amp;#x200B;

The  ultimate aim in Squingball is basically pretty much the same as every  other sport out there − to score more points than the opposition.  Scoring is worked out in the game as follows:

### Squinks (6 points)

A  titular ""Squink"" is scored when a team crosses the opposition's goal  line with the ball, or catches or collects the ball in the Tall Goal  zone.

### Tall Goal (3 points)

A  team will usually attempt these on the fourth Hookdie - if the kickman  is close enough to the Tall Goal zone to kick the ball into the net.

### Extra Point (1 or 2 points)

An  extra point is earned by kicking the ball into the net (it’s similar to  a conversion in rugby). Two points are earned by taking the ball into  the Tall Goal zone, but since it is more difficult, most teams opt to  take the 1pt.

### Safety (2 points)

The Good guys can gain 2 points if they tackle, or ""destroy"", a member of the enemies with the ball in their own Tall Goal zone.

&amp;#x200B;

I  hope that you will all try out Squingball with your own group of  friends, and get it the recognition that We think it deserves! We can't  think of anything else like it!",Spratfell,1639269040

What if there was a website where a creator of art/gifs/short relatable vids could post something that relates to a them or genre they really like then someone else can pay a small amount to get a copy of this content on their account and it increases the overall value of the content by a small percentage.
But here's the cool part anyone that now sees that persons account can buy a copy from the other buyer which will give half the profit to the original creator and half to the buyer he bought a copy from and the overall value of the content goes up a little bit more once again.

I think the idea of profiles having random bits of relatable or likeable content all over them like pop figurines or achievements that go up in value as almost a bragging right like ""Hey I own this gif that represents my like for a genre or character that is now valued at a crazy high amount, woo hoo."" While giving profits to anyone who has their copy purchased by another (creating a new copy for that person) which then further increases the value and gives a portion of the profits back to the original creator would be a gimmick that in some way works and might be fun.

 The idea of owning an account that basically shows off your likes, has a way to give you pride if something you create or own becomes really valuable and a way to GIVE YOU MONEY just by others who find your account also having those likes then deciding to add those things to their collection by purchasing a copy from you would really intrigue allot of people and get a little popular in my opinion.

Would it work or fail in your opinion? Is this basically what NFTs are?",The_Libra_V,1639208604

1791,Marketing Contest,"We've all seen a contest by a big company where you promote their product with a hashtag, and you might win a small prize.

example: https://www.instagram.com/p/BNR7XdHh3VV/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=b3d9c09c-dae9-45cc-9cac-fac2c788ba85

This ^ contest only gave out $500 to 9 people after a 2 week contest, with a hashtag in use of 36,851. Not bad I suppose. I'm sure the corporate big wigs have crunched the numbers on it and decided it was worth their time/money.

But *what if* a company made this contest not only a lot more winnable, but with a bigger prize too. For example, similar approach as the above Starbucks example:
- post a photo with the product
- use the required hashtag
- instead of a 2 week contest, we make it a month long contest and do it every month.
- instead of a prize of $500, we make it $1000
- instead of 9 winners, we have 1,000 winners per month.
- 1 post per person per month limitation 


Sure, that works out to 1 million dollars a month in prizes, but let's say this is a big company like Starbucks. Starbucks already spends 6 million a month on marketing. Using 1 of that 6 million on this contest approach doesn't seem so crazy when you look at how much they spend already...

The idea is that there are multiple resonate frequencies that exist for things. All the exposed functional groups in the molecules, the atomic bonds, (deeper?), and basically every atom and molecule and interaction might have one o rmore Fzs that can cause it to gain more energy than it can handle and breakdown.       
By energizing a target with a super widespectrum photonic blast you might be able to get some reflections to determine what areas and harmonics to target.
Now the kicker here is that the photos (most pass through the target) are all entrained to another photon which is *directly next* to the first one. The *stretching* from above is about the distance, polarity, speed (how nearby it is) from one to the other. The reason for this is to have a second matching photon ready to 'slap-back' the first interaction thus causing more damage. Singe things breakdown and their results are differnt the ful specturm shoudl be contantaly applied and some paetrs super amplified and targetd.",cinnamintdown,1639113423

And, as in the title, realistic gun damage. If you get shot, and your wearing body armor  *rated for that bullet* and **the bullet hits the armor** you survive, but are injured. For example, if you are wearing level 3 body armor, and are shot in the armor with a 9mm, you survive, but have busted ribs, so you can't run or anything like that. If you are shot in a place not protected by armor, (like the legs) you're just fucked. If you're wearing level 3 soft armor, and are shot center mass with a .308, you're fucked. 

Realistic weapon weight. A Barrett M107 is 27.4 pounds before you add the weight of ammo. You're just not gonna be doing a bunch of acrobatics while lugging around a 30 pound, 4 foot long rifle.  Accordingly, super heavy armor is just that: super heavy. If you're wearing top end soft armor with ceramic plates, and a kevlar helmet rated for high power rifles, it's gonna weigh at least 30 pounds. And your armor becomes less effective after each hit. And is very expensive to replace.

1896,Completely invert income inequality by using another currency,"Billionaires and CEOs who award themselves 1000x the wage of their own workers are rich in US DOLLARS. Now say you don't accept US dollars for the widgets you sell; then US dollars are worthless paper, and you have the item of value (widget). Get it? 

Trust me, this system is already in use within the US in ethnic neighborhoods. One price for members, a much higher price for outsiders. The actual currency changing hands may or may not be US dollars - it doesn't matter, as long as there's an agreed rate and both sides of the transaction take place with the closed community. Housing, food stores, and necessities are all available within the neighborhood at member rates. When outsiders come to their shops and restaurants, they pay. Community members are identifiable by their ethnicity and language. It's easy to discern who gets insider pricing.

It's when greedy people get control of goods, property, and medicine and charge you an outrageous price that you have a problem. When middle-income people get lazy and can't be arsed to help their parents fix up their home to sell, so they sell it to a house flipper or investor or developer instead of a family, we have a problem. The property left your economic class and is not coming back. 

The neighbor who works construction charges too much to help fix up this house because he ""needs the money."" So he takes jobs from people who will pay higher and higher prices. His time and his skills are given out of the neighborhood. 

A mom can't ""afford"" to take a part time job in a shop on her street because her rent is too high, so the shop can't find employees and has to close and Amazon takes over its market share. This cycle has to be broken.

We need a poor man's union with its own currency. 

We need poor men's supply chains from farm to table, forest to construction, fuel, medicine, off-grid renewable power, and housing, intersecting the billionaire sector as little as possible. When we stop giving them our money, they'll be forced to lower their prices and raise our wages, and some equilibrium can be achieved.",benny-the-rennie,1638985499

It can be done by other things too, like maybe you could get paid by transaction if it’s a banking program. Maybe you’ve been automated out of the cashier position. No worries, you’ll still get paid the same (or more) because now you’ll get paid by transaction via those automatic scanners. 

The whole system can sort of be like a UBI, except maybe you’ll still get the benefits like any other job (i.e. family support or holiday breaks, that way you won’t be punished just because the machine happened to break while you were celebrating your holiday or taking your vacation).

- For every urban tree removed, the property owner must provide for the planting of a set of 5 trees, prioritizing evergreen, food-producing, and xeriscape species.

- any new buildings can not add to the burden on the power grid. Any additional amperage from what is currently supplied to that lot must come from solar/wind on that lot.

- All flat roofs are required to have either solar panels or green space. No more acres of useless rooftop heating up the buildings.

- make graywater usage part of average construction. Homes should all have graywater filters. Innovate soap that breaks down quickly, so it can go through outdoor watering equipment.

1971,Replace kids believing in Santa Claus with kids believing in Jacob Marley's ghost,"Okay it's Holly Jolly Jingle Jangle Season up here in the Northern Hemisphere, a time when we collectively invented holidays to stave off the dark, slow death by cold that winter brought a significant chunk of our ancestors for the majority of human history. Now, one of the endemic traditions in any area influenced by Europe is that of Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas, Belsnickel, Sinterklaas, Pere Noel, etc, the aged gift bringer of midwinter who has his roots in a strange blend of both Germanic and Roman pagan figures, an early Christian gift-giving bishop, and oddest of all, early 19th century New Yorkers like Washington Irving making shit up to provide a uniquely answer to British veneration of Saint George. At any rate, by this time in our history, Santa Claus has swept the world as the anthropomorphizing of the holidays themselves, similar to one of his folkloric predecessors, English Father Christmas. 

When I have kids, I am likely going to incorporate the red-suited gent somewhere as a symbol of the season into my traditions, because I have fond beautiful memories of the lengths my parents went to so as to infuse my Christmases with magic. But some people have serious issues with the tradition. There's the claim that it teaches kids that their parents lie, that it's closet theism, or enforces a surveillance state-like attitude, that it enforces classism because rich kids get better gifts, and in countries like the Netherlands where Santa has African slaves due to a 19th century Dutch adaptation, racism. I've read compelling arguments on both sides, and I'm not here to argue for or against having Santa Claus as a tradition with your kids. What I am here to do, is to offer an alternative: Jacob Marley.

For those that haven't seen any of the hundreds of adaptations of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, a book that Dickens wrote to make some quick cash and as an appeal for his peers to be more charitable but became literally the rejuvenation of a holiday that was been suffocated in Britain by the Industrial Revolution and reinvented Christmas as a family holiday, Jacob Marley is a ghost. Specifically, the heavily chained, hell-tortured ghost of miser Ebenezer Scrooge's business partner, who appears to him on Christmas Eve to appeal to him to change his ways or otherwise to be doomed to Marley's fate. Marley shows Scrooge a mind-bending procession of similarly chained ghosts in the sky and in the streets of London, lamenting their fate and their inability to help others because it's too late. I think the current incarnation of Santa Claus couldn't be further from his roots as a wild-eyed miracle working fanatical bishop who literally fought Greek gods according to folktales (his enemy was Artemis, seemingly), and who gave away his family fortune to strangers in secret. We've gone too far to go back, and we're a pretty secular society now. Reverting to the cultic veneration of a Catholic saint wouldn't bode well for a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic civilization. 

So who's a solid figure to change it up to? Who's a supernatural figure of a type that 2 in 5 Americans believe to be real (ghosts), is anti-greed and argues for sacrificing for others and pursuing the welfare of the less fortunate around you? Jacob fuckin' Marley. Secular, anti-consumerism, pro-generosity, no toys to be delivered if you follow an arbitrary ethical guideline, just a screaming chained ghost. Hell, if you did want to do a punishment/reward style thing, the guy literally is condemned to carry around money boxes for eternity. You leave a tarnished old British coin on your kid's bedside table or in their shoe, it's a pretty potent reminder to mind your p's and q's, even if they don't literally believe a fictional ghost from British literature is visiting. 

TLDR (even though I hope you do because I tucked a bunch of fun holiday lore in there): If you find the promotion of the Santa Claus tradition exhausting or unethical, go for a figure equally as valid and perhaps more in line with your ethos: the terrifying social welfare-encouraging ghost written by the guy who helped invent modern Christmas as we know it.",IsCaptainKiddAnAdult,1638774353

...but, for our cultural future's sake, it might be beneficial to include subjective narrative techniques for *describing* hard-to-pin-down-yet-sentimentally-detectable “plotlines”: instrumental music pieces, songs' lyrics('s interpretation), experimental novels and short stories, poems, articles, essay films and documentaries, commercials and advertising posters, music videos, dance shows, paintings, photographs, video games, standup specials and comedy sketches, various sculptures, memorable buildings, remarkable parks, extraordinary cars, boats and planes, and any kind of *special* technological invention or graphic design project or gastronomic outcome... even if only special for *that* summary's author. 

So pretty much including anything that could be perceived as having *a* *story* of being created the way it was, beyond some viable primary/functional role. 

Some Wikipedia/Reddit combo structure would allow IMDb-type of multiple synopses aside from the marketer's/publisher's official ones, with a GoodReads-like simple listing of them all. And each piece should display the content's number of words (conciseness being encouraged, yet not compulsory).  

The inherent subjective results (of different people describing the same *story,* and then comparing them) could be valuable for the rest of the “audience”, compelling for researchers and scholars... and intriguing for the individual authors themselves. 

It will certainly become helpful for future plotline-oriented web searches (and, in a couple of centuries, it might cut in half the TipOfMyTongue-subreddit's queries :) 

For example, a horror author's conceptual choice could be to omit using a 	specific *revealing* word in the text of a certain novel (“ghost”, “sand”, “blood”, “angel”, “demon”, “butterfly” etc), while a fantasy writer might enforce an anti-spoiler ban on reviews disclosing certain expressions from the body of the work (“twin ghosts”, “sand-licker”, “bloody butterfly”, “angels playing demons” etc)... But if through an unavoidable “duck test” it's clear what a certain *thing* is and *that*'s the thing that sticks in someone's memory from any of those works, then only *subjective* retellings of such *camouflaged* stories could make a future reader (re)discover that particular novel some years/centuries after its release. 

(K.M. Weiland's “Story Structure Database” currently targets only 4 narrative forms of art (“Books”, “Movies”, “Short Stories”, “Video Games”), and only indexes one synopsis per story, and each one is kind of technical, since her website's paradigm targets *structure,* not plot description.)",KeepMovieng,1638628416

2117,"Are you the owner of a local used car dealership? Run a big promotion about your prices being ""crazy low."" Then force yourself to be committed to a local mental hospital.","The ads write themselves. Just footage of you wandering around the car lot, commenting on how ""insanely low,"" ""crazy low,"" etc your prices are. Then get yourself committed. People will think, ""man, I guess your prices really were insane.""

Now, the hard part is going to be committed. The hospital is unlikely to agree to this, as committing someone as a publicity stunt is probably a huge patient and professional ethics violation.You're probably going to have to get committed by actually appearing to have a serious mental episode. 

Now, you have to do this carefully. Running through downtown naked with a butcher knife, screaming about the lizard people controlling your brain won't do. Sure, that will make people think you are crazy, but not that your prices are crazy. You don't want people to think you're a crazy person who just happens to sell cars, you want them to think your insanity is specifically related to your sales practices. Moreover, you want them to think they can actually take advantage of your condition to get a great deal.

Thus, whatever delusions you project should somehow relate to having ridiculously low car prices. Maybe wander naked through downtown, ranting about how all the cars have ""your nanotech"" in them, and anyone who gets in one is mind controlled, and how you just need to get enough people to sit in your cars before you have an army powerful enough to ""take over the world!!!"" Lots of shouting ""I'll show them all."" That sort of thing. Just some laughably impractical, ridiculously elaborate plot which getting a car sale somehow advances. Keep these ""symptoms"" up until you're forcibly committed, and keep yourself in there for as long as possible.

Meanwhile, your dealership is enjoying record sales. People will believe that your cars are artificially cheap because you've priced them planning some ridiculous grand plan that clearly has no basis in reality. They'll be thinking they're getting a great deal, when in reality they're being fleeced. And the best part? There's no reason to even guilty about this deception!

2124,"We're not living in an ancestor simulation, we're living in a story simulation","Apologies in advance for the long post, so the tl;dr is **If we are living in a simulation, it's probably a mirror of the ""infinite monkey theorem\*"", either to find the perfect equation or the perfect story to explain the universe.**

The prevailing evidence for simulation theory is that any sufficiently advanced civilization would have the technology to create many universe simulations, so the odds of us living in a ""real"" universe are low because there would be relatively few real ones compared to simulated ones. 

The prevailing hypothesis about why advanced civs would create simulations of the universe is to play out the lives of ancestors, see their day-to-day in high detail with hyper-realistic people (because they/we are ""real"", of course, even if simulated.)

However, this has never really jived with me. If you had a universe simulator, what would you do with it? What do we do with Sims characters when given free rein? 

We get invested in their story and we fuck with them to see what they will do.

Hence, I think there are two more likely, not mutually exclusive, scenarios than the ancestor simulation theory. 

1. **Entertainment**. Whatever advanced civ/dimensional being created the simulation is doing it for shits and/or giggles. Think Netflix but more interesting because every story is ""real"". Almost all of humans' mental bandwidth is taken up thinking about stories and narratives in some form or another, don't see any reason to think that other intelligent beings wouldn't be the same.
2. **Science**. Whatever advanced civ created the simulation is doing it to create different physical paramenters of the universe to find out some fundamental truth about the universe. Whether life or intelligent life is part of that experiment is up for debate.

Scenario 1 is pretty self-explanatory, but I think there is some increasingly outlandish but possible evidence for Scenario 2. Such as:

* **Universal Speed Limit -** The speed of light is a universal constant, and with its connection to spacetime, almost seems like an arbitrary limit placed on the universe to make sure spacetime only expands away from the point of the Big Bang at a certain rate.
* **No Time Before Time -** To piggyback on the universal speed limit, it's science's understanding that there was nothing before the Big Bang. We currently have no way of measuring what existed before or exists outside the universe. That could be by design.
* **""If We Can, We Will"" + Farming Out the Work -** As intelligent beings, we are constantly on the search for new horizons, new answers, and new understanding. When there is some equation or fundamental question that we can't figure out, we spend massive amounts of time and energy to do so. (Look at the Large Hadron Collider, for example.) If we could create a million different universes in an isolated setting, watch them play out in an instant, and record our findings, we would definitely do it, even if, maybe especially if, those universes were guaranteed to have intelligent life develop within them. If time existed differently for the experiment universes, we could test an uncountable number of hypotheses incredibly quickly from our perspective by letting the intelligent creatures within those universes do the experiments for us. Take that perspective one level up.
* **Fermi Paradox Answer -** A possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that life / intelligent life was only ""allowed"" to grow in isolation. When we conduct experiments on our planet, we reduce the number of variables to as few as possible to understand cause and effect. If the universal experiment theorem is true and life is an intentional part of it, then perhaps the experimenters didn't want their petri dishes mixing, so to speak.
* **The Existence of Time -** They say we're three-dimensional beings moving through four-dimensional space at a constant speed. To understand cause and effect, time is a necessity. Equations and stories are expressions of meaning through time. If the universe was created to entertain or to help the experimenters discover something, they would need a framework that allows a beginning, middle, and end.
* **Divine Fuckery, part 1: Set it and forget it -** On the ""decreasingly likely"" side of the evidence, if we take many holy scriptures at face value (obviously a big 'if'), then we see a lot of meddling in human affairs by divine or extraterrestrial/extradimensional beings back in the day, and very little today. The prevailing idea is that all those guys and gals were nuts or tripping balls on desert drugs, but it's possible the experimenters wanted to modify the starting parameters, then once the experiment was up and running, chose to let it play out.  
In a ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" kind of way, we could have been coaxed toward intelligence for the purposes of the experiment. This could also be an explanation for Scenario 1.
* **Divine Fuckery, part 2: The Word of God -** The gods interacted with humans through symbols and stories, and expressed meaning and intention through symbols and stories. Holy texts are almost exclusively parable-based, and though it's most likely because our brains remember stories best, it's possible our brains remember stories because that's how everything was originally framed for us. This one's obviously a little fuzzy, but in magic and religion, the ""true names"" of things have immense power. Names are words, and words tell stories. 

That's all I can think of in terms of possible evidence. Again, the tl;dr is **If we are living in a simulation, it's probably a mirror of the ""infinite monkey theorem"", either to find the perfect experiment/equation to explain the universe or just create damn good stories with real people and real stakes.**

Oh, and one more piece of evidence for Scenario 1. The information age. We move more and more toward a more connected, over-communicated world. If every picture is worth 1000 words and every sentence is a little story, then the rate of words and stories being generated and stored by our species has just multiplied by exponential orders of magnitude in the last few decades. 

I'm not sure that is by design, necessarily, but maybe every social species eventually creates an internet and begins generating a massive amount more data than before.

I know that they already do this but what I mean is that they just do more of it, like make some of the best clips, or most talked-about clips or even just a clip for every episode of a show be readily available to people who have subscribed to their services already. Because even though there are a lot of people who use these streaming platforms, a lot of them still seem to prefer to watch certain clips instead of just watching the actual episodes.

2183,CQCC = Corona Quarantine Chitchat Connection,"(because I couldn't find a suitable U-word in order to spin a cool CQCU (“Seek-You/See-You”) acronym)   

CQCC could be a friendly online communication “protocol” encouraging people to reconnect with *forgotten* personal/professional contacts from one of their social networks' indexes. Video is advisable. 

The Coronavirus-inflicted isolation would act as a diplomatic pretense. Because we all have *unknown* contacts that seem interesting enough not to deserve a connection severance... 

...like that 517th name that appears in your Facebook list and doesn't ring any bells although all your common 63 “friends” are awesome... or that one on LinkedIn displaying a cool job at some 	Elon Musk-approved KidsForMars NGO... or that recommended videos' TikTok user that you \[insert-here-what-you-know-about-TikTok-because-I-don't\]. 

**The Courteous Connection Protocol** 

(which is not compulsory, so it can be ignored, but it looks cryptic, therefore it's cool, so you gotta try it, and here's the way) 

The requester sends a short alphanumerical *chain* message like “CQCC/2021/12/07/18001820?”, loosely translatable as ”Hello, fellow quarantined human-or-alien-spy-understanding-my-native-language, how about a little 20-minute chitchat on December 7th, starting at 18.00 (your local time), so we can reacquaint 	ourselves with each other's existential bearings...?” 

Mentioning solely the starting hour (“1800” and nothing else before the “?”) would mean that the requester doesn't mind when the chitchat ends. 

If the receiver intends to dismiss the request (or if the receiver is an illiterate alien creature), the request should be simply ignored – because, by the CQCC's *No-answer-means-a-”No”-answer* principle, a request has the precise expiration threshold of 101 minutes\*, and no exceptions should be admitted whatsoever\*\*... 

...whereas in the case of a polite receiver that doesn't want to have a chitchat with that requester (or in the case of a highly cultivated non-earthling unwilling to disclose the forthcoming alien invasion's first wave), the answer's message should be an abrupt  “CQCC/” message and *basta*. 

If intending to return a positive answer, the receiver should repeat the chain message (and maybe add a suggested ending time, if it's not included in the request) and complete it with an assuring “!” 	confirmation: “CQCC/2021/12/07/18001900!” 

...but, if the proposed day/time is not feasible, the receiver should answer with a counter-offer altering the proposed time accordingly, and then end it again with a “?” For example: “CQCC/2021/12/07/19302000?... to which the (initial) requester has to give an acknowledgment by repeating the same chain and then end it with an “!”... or give a counter-counter-offer with another “?” ending... 

...and so on, until there's a final *acceptance* answer having the liberating “!” closure. 

If necessary, corresponding phone numbers can be inserted into the request/answer chain – between the “CQCC” and the “year”.   

Chat away!

2242,I don't want to pay welfare,"Greed? Anything but greed. I feel uncomfortable with this role of my taxes in the economy.  My concern is deeper than pockets. It is moral corruption. How paying money to people in hardship might be a cause of moral corruption on both sides? It is a shiny core of humanism. Let’s look.

The main point of humanism is to address others as humans, the same species. Not good, not b-a-a-a-d. To address as brothers, and don’t be fooled by the positive connotations. Brother fight is one of the worst. Barely, we can translate it to ‘equal’.

We want to be humane and we are getting better and better in this business. However, the question is the method. What is the communicative position in the current layout? By paying tax money I take the moral ground to judge those who get the help. Well, I have high moral principles and do not judge anyone. OK, let’s pretend I believe. But then the whole fact of your resistance to the temptation is the support of your moral integrity for yourself and, consequently, cannot be distinguished from pride, and we are back to square one. 

Such moral contradiction is a symptom of the bad implementation of a good idea. What do the principles of humanism say? Address as equal. It means business. An exchange. Business is inhumane. Well… Sometimes, absolutely yes. 

For example, if it is the sale of fear. When one person threatens another person and receives money for not doing bad things. Just like now. The only positive feedback we have in the current framework in return for the money is a non-verbal promise not to rob stores. I’m not OK with this situation. I want to help people, it is in our nature. But I don’t want to fight with more temptations than I actually have to. In the case of taxes, I have enough problems dealing with my greed. When I will be on the other side of the equation (we all can be, so ‘when’), I don’t want that someone thinks about me as a potential criminal. I'm not and I will not be, even if today I'm in trouble.

OK, smart ass, what can we do? Simple. Find the useful thing that anyone getting social money can do and pay for this thing. Easy. Easy? Easy! Run all social payments through the system of community colleges and other adult education scholarship programs. If you need social money, you are not adopted into society. Here is your chance, go to college and get the knowledge that will help you at some point jump back to independent life and help others to do the same later. If you just need a year of refreshing, get the latest computer science. If you need a year of settling the mind and getting a class of philosophy.

If you consider yourself hopeless, not a problem. Go, take a class in art or theater. Enjoy your life. Back to the robbery scam… A robber with a degree in contemporary art? A robber? Not a swindler? Give me a break. If we pay all social payments as a scholarship, we boost the ambient level of culture. We paying real money for the real thing, not implied blackmail, not fake moral stands. It is a real contribution to society and shall be paid accordingly.

I’ll tell you more. We have to think about the scale of the sponsorship system. Let’s look at Validation. If you are in the system, you have to keep your mouth shut, because when you are not, you are or kicking somebody’s ass or kissing another one. First is bad for career, second is bad for the soul. You have to respect tradeoffs of quality for ship-it-now. Is there a solution? Yes.

If, and only if, the Validation is completely outsourced and Quality Architect is a consultant and not just a contractor, but a consultant impersonated by an agency. Beyond the technical ability to understand the business process, the consultant shall have no loyalty to the company, so no conflict of interests will stand between such a consultant and brutal reality. Does your chief of Validation report to the VP of Engineering? You do have small dirty lies in the structure. I cannot say this, because he is a nice guy and we will work together more…. Nice, humane, polite. Lies. BTW, this is exactly the reason I’ll never come back to work for hire. It is not worth it, money cannot compensate the damages.

How it is related to sponsorship? The creative brain is the scariest resource of the coming century. We need the best, but we cannot afford them, because most of the time they are losing opportunities and we cannot compensate for lost profit. It is too expensive to keep genius when he knows what he can do without you. Solution? Not a problem, I have one.

We need to see the community of creative people as a swarm, like free birds. Don’t chase the bird of luck, give some nice food and wait, it will come. Don’t catch. Use and let go. In the coming years, we will see more and more people who will use systems like Patreon as the main source of income. Probably, I’m ahead of this trend, but I will not accept money from companies other than Patreon. You, as corporate leaders, need to be ready for the situation, when the best part of the company’s resources isn’t obliged to be in the company at all. You do not just have to ask every time, you have to see your employees as subcontractors and plan your project accordingly. And yes, it will be your project. Not their, not ours, yours.

You, as corporate leaders will need to stop cheating on business with a human face. It failed for socialism, it will fail for you. You have to be ready to start buying the product of the people on their terms because the best people will stop selling their souls. It will happen very soon. As soon as people will understand, that they can. If you are enjoying being boss, you better do it now on a full scale, because time is running. A couple of years and you will no longer see an employee if what you give is only the money. You will have to do something meaningful, something that will bring people to your project besides money. But all this is a romantic fleur of the future. 

Is our payroll system ready? I mean not only the private sector but big players. IRS, Federal Reserve, customs? Do we have planning tools for swarm processes? MS Project died with Agile. Agile is not that agile to address the future. Do we have the communication protocols to create the on-demand swarm of creative for the given project? I think, our business and social protocols need to be reviewed down to the Agrarian Revolution. It is huge and urgent work. I see it as a massive refactoring of our cultural code and handling some mistakes.

Are our social system and adult education ready for the increasing volume? Most likely, it will be exponential growth in demand caused by the coming technology shift. Shall we start doing something about it or we are going to handle it our pandemic style? Or panda style, sit on a couch with popcorn and watch the news? It is a new interesting time coming, we all will be on both sides of this swing, trust me. Let’s make it humane, so we will keep respecting each other no matter how strange the coming world will be.",SugarMaleficent6721,1638251072

This would foster the amicable collaboration of spouses, and the wealth-building of platonic partners. Say two single moms sharing a house and raising their kids together.

With many people out of work and who don't want corporate jobs any more, people need to reconsider the peacefulness of herding. Get a couple of goats. Make a deal with your municipality, or a business with a large lawn, such as an office park, church, or school, to keep a section of highway verge (or their lawn) mowed. It won't pay much, if anything. You're doing it for free feed, mostly. Put your goats on tethers and move them along the highway verge as they eat the grass. While you're waiting, do online college classes from your laptop in your pickup truck. Breed the goats and graze 6-10 of them at a time. Sell them when they're grown. As they eat their way down the road, the county should seed it with alfalfa. Now the highway grows good hay. Instead of just shredding down wild growth, the county can hay the highway verges and medians and sell the hay at low cost. Now all the local ranchers have access to low-cost hay. Get a couple of feedlot calves for free and (once they can graze) raise them as 100% grass-fed beef. 

Goats can access and mow steep highway embankments, re-green bare areas as they pass back and forth and leave manure, work around obstacles such as stones, and return multiple benefits to multiple people, unlike tractors (for this purpose) which are an expense. 

The goats require labor to tend them, but the laborer can be a person of any age or skill level. Goats can be brought into the city to mow the complex highway embankments, and homeless people can be herders.",benny-the-rennie,1638196016

2354,I’m about to start producing CircuitMess Batmobile - a DIY robot car that teaches kids about STEM sciences,"Hi everyone,

As you may remember, my name is Albert, and I'm a 22-year-old DIY electronics enthusiast who also happens to be a huge Batman fan. 🦇

Earlier, I have posted here about CircuitMess Batmobile, a project I have developed after getting the license from Warner Bros and which is aimed to teach kids technologies of the future (such as AI, machine learning, computer vision, and more). 

I have received really nice feedback from the people in this group, so I wanted to notify you all that my Batmobile is now funded and that I will officially start producing this kit soon. ✨

The crowdfunding campaign will be live for 6 more days, meaning that you can still pre-order your Batmobile or support the project if you find it interesting. Here’s the link to the listing, where you can also get more info about Batmobile’s software and hardware:

Anyways, here's my business plan; fooking YEETING water balloons to thirsty af homies in other countries, using reusable rockets.

Hear me out. I know this sounds vaguely familiar to imperialist military strategy, but no, this payload is totally just water collected in the rainforest.

This is the crazy ideas reason because I'm taking this idea to the max. Can we justify destroying like a square mile of pristine irreplaceable rainforest to collect an insane volume of water and fill up a nearby tank for solving droughts and getting fresh water to the dudes around the world who need it?

Not just like, here's enough water to not die of thirst amounts, but like an open source freshwater hookup. Like, oh your desert geography has a deep rock-lined reservoir built by us taxpayers and Army Corps of Engineers, that seems like an ideal space to create an oasis and relief terrible stresses from countries forecasted to have excess drought.

Free industrial farming amounts of freshwater to feed massive agricultural industry under the searing sun. Pop one of these massive tanks in the ground and you got big political influence in the farmers tending to land building a previously non-existent economy into an agricultural juggernaut. You invest into this totally broken region by ABSOLUTELY YEETING water balloons by rockets, thousands of gallons per launch. 

Or build a prefab design that's just like a big cornhole box that will catch all the gallons of water that recharge the tank for very isolated and independent farming operations from massive central water tanks guarded by the military. We turn these countries into our breadbasket on our terms cause we got that wet-wet u-knowumsaiyan. Our slogan will be, if you got a hole we got that wet-wet.

You don't need to fly that aggressively either since it would just be sub-orbital trajectories for the yeet-proper. You just need the hookup for fuel production (Hydrogen/oxygen) powered by one of those SMR nuclear plants.",crackercider,1637989521

It would be pretty easy to research and find out what percentage went to various expenses in that year, and what they did not spend money on. If we want to return to middle-class prosperity, we should illuminate some modern expense categories. For example, respecting a social contract in which people are not lawsuit happy would reduce needless spending on some types of insurances. Improving public transit would enable more household to do fine with just one car. Improving work from home would allow more parents to raise their own children, instead of kids being raised in front of a TV in daycare at a high price. people were not paying over $100 a month for cable TV. They learned from their parents how to do a lot of household repairs and maintenance themselves, and they were able to be home more to take care of their lawns. Public schools were delivering a more comprehensive education, which has since been stripped out, compelling people to pay in junior college for what they used to get for free in public high school.

2665,"2045, the centennial of the end of WW2, is just 24 years away. Even generations later, Europe's Jewish population has yet to even remotely recover. To make up for past sins, Germany should restore European Jewry, by any means necessary.","The Holocaust was an unmitigated travesty whose magnitude cannot even be conveyed in words. Compounding the tragedy is that generations later, the European Jewish population has yet to recover to anything remotely similar to its previous levels. In 1930, Poland had approximately 3 million Jewish people living within its borders. Today, that number is about 5,000. This is a tragedy we cannot allow to stand. Germany should endeavor to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Holocaust with a total, utter rebuke of the efforts of Hitler and the Nazis. They should endeavor to fully reverse Hitler's goal of purging Europe of its Jewish population. They should do this with utter determination, whatever the cost. Hitler cannot be allowed to win.

To this end, Germany should throw its full diplomatic, financial, industrial, and military capabilities towards this great task. They should offer massive, absurdly generous subsidies to encourage Jewish people to move to Germany and Eastern European countries, and offer them gigantic tax credits for having large numbers of children. 

The full might of modern technology should be deployed to this glorious task. The German state might consider paying for gamete samples to be collected from Jewish people in the US and Israel, and then paying German women to serve as surrogate mothers on a massive scale. Rabbis will be flown in to Germany by the planeload and put to the task of raising up new generation of a greatly expanded European Jewry. 

And, if these methods prove not enough, Germany should adopt a final solution. If peaceful means fail, then force must be used. Their mission is simply too important. If all other means fail, Germany should endeavor to restore the European Jewish population, by force. Germany should invade Israel itself, and force millions of its citizens to involuntarily migrate to Germany to rebuild the ranks of Germany's Jewish population. If necessary, living space will be arranged for them by seizing land in neighboring countries such as Poland. 

This is something that can be done. This is something that must be done. By the triumph of the will, the hundred year anniversary of WW2 should be marked by a complete reversal of the dreams of Hitler and the Nazi party. Germany must do this. Hitler cannot be allowed to win.",isleepinahammock,1637208514

2668,A multi-player game with an Open-source front-end.,"Host the front-end on github, allow pull requests and let the player base contribute to bug fixes and exploit patching. Made sure the client has a well developed Continuous Devlivery solution, and the developers can merge or decline PRs at their discretion.

The backend for the game should still be private - after all, you don't want to give away your secrets for free - but with a public open source front-end you could probably offload a ton of work by having enthusiasts contribute to fixes, especially small scale fixes like localization issues or UI tweaks that your team just cba to implement.

Downside is probably the fact that if there's an exploit and you're not on top of it, it can be heavily abused. But if there IS an exploit there are high chances that a very angry player base will contribute fixes to it out of sheer anger.

Another downside would probably be pirating; even in a GaaS type of game, people could ""just"" create their own backend, so the game company would need to be on top to provide a better service.

A great upside would be a massive user generated content and nodding support. Players would probably create an entire modding ecosystem that could be integrated into the client itself, and it could allow your game to evolve in very versatile manners.

While in the state of fasting you become less hungry because your bodies metabolism isn't rolling and it clears out whatever is in your system at the time. People who don't have daily access to food and these things can purposely fast instead of immediately eating what they find because once they do so their metabolism begins and they end up staying hungry .

What to do with publicly owned religious buildings: Churches and other holy places could still be used freely by the people, and some kind of a non-religious public organization would be formed for their management and for the people using them, so that those people could vote for who gets to speak and when. But only private people (and basically any private people, popular enough) would be allowed to hold speeches in them. No hate speech, politics or advertisement, naturally.

2691,Compel standardization and re-use of containers to reduce plastic production,"Every consumable product likes to have its recognizable container shape for marketing. So wasteful. When you buy such things as salad dressing, spices, juice, shampoo, condiments, anything that comes in a bottle or jar, The jar and lid should be standardized and have a code molded in. Just like Mason jars have always been. When you buy a product, the top can be sealed, like many of them already are, with a little plastic seal, and in the same aisle, there should be bins of standard sized lids that you can take only if you need one. You don't need a new peanut butter jar lid every time you buy peanut butter, for example. The lid could actually last for years. They should also discontinue the multiple seals that you find on many products. You don't need a seal outside the lid, then a brand new plastic lid, then another seal inside of that. Just one seal, and a lid is optional. This would immediately cut down on a significant amount of plastic pollution.

All public places should also be required to provide drinking water. Bottled water is absolutely absurd. This includes convenience stores, many convenient stores offer coffee refills in your own cup. They should do the same for water instead of selling bottled water. Even if they charge you $.10 or $.50 for cold, good filtered water in your own bottle, it is really truly time to make bottled water a thing of the past.

Another enormous waste is prescription bottles. You do not need a brand new plastic bottle and lid every time you get a refill. The pharmacist should dispense into a little paper envelope, and staple a new label to it, that you Peel off and stick on your own prescription bottle, so you have the date and details of the prescription for each refill. If for some reason they are concerned about putting a drug into a different bottle, pharmacies should allow you to bring your old prescription bottle in, show them the refill is for the same drug, and they will put on the fresh label for you.

Fast food containers should also be standard sized and reusable. You should be able to turn in a standardized, fliptop or clamshell type plastic container that is sized for a burger, an order of fries, and a drink cup, and exchange them when you pick up a food order. Restaurants already have to handle purchasing, storage, and disposal of single use containers. They can positively manage cleaning and stacking reusable ones. What the industry needs is a new technology for cleaning and sanitizing plastic containers. An industry that can automate a fast food restaurant can also invent such a machine.",benny-the-rennie,1637178579

2714,A PBSKids reboot of the TV show (based on the book series) Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle with Melissa McCarthy as the title character,"I know this seems weird and afaik (e.g. unless they did a reboot of the books like they did with Amelia Bedelia) the books are super-old so they'd have to be updated (that's why it's crazy because it's old and obscure) but I basically grew up on Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle both the books and getting out the videos of the old TV series (don't remember who played Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle in that series but I remember she was clearly thin while if you look at the illustrations of the books Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle while not quite being fat fat per se was very clearly ""not-thin"" hence why I'd want Melissa McCarthy) from the library and as though idr how the old show updated them the books are so old Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's telephone number wasn't a ten-digit code but a word and a couple of numbers I think the show could use a modernization.

For those who didn't grow up with Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, she was essentially a Mary-Poppins-type (it's just instead of nannying one household until the wind changed she had a fixed home and was someone a whole bunch of families in her neighborhood could consult on for problems as they came up) who helped cure children of their negative habits/tendencies through either magic-potion-esque-things (like a spray that made a girl who was so careless she often broke valuable things by accident move slowly and gracefully enough her parents compared it/her to royalty) or special items (like curing a ""slow-eater-tiny-bite-taker"" through sets of special dishes of varying sizes she gave to his parents who were advised to gradually shrink his dishes over time) or just ""behavior modification"" she advised the parents to do (like stopping squabbling siblings through advising the parents to squabble similarly with each other to show the kids how the parents feel) and why the books made a great TV show is because 90% of the stories (the ones that didn't were often ""mythology ones"" more about Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's life but still featured her helping kids) followed a specific kid/sibling-set's ""case"" from identification-of-problem to consult with Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle to implementation of solution and mitigation of unintended consequence. And just imagine what new things she'd have ""Cure""s for (as that's how all the stories and episodes-they-turned-into were referred to, The [something, 90% of the time the bad behavior but sometimes like in The Radish Cure they alluded to the solution] Cure) in today's modern age.

As for why PBSKids (regardless of if the original was on PBSKIds or not though I get the feeling if it was I'd see it on more retro listicles) it's because that's a surefire way to get this hypothetical show (and the lessons it teaches) out to the-masses-who-don't-have-cable and shows like Arthur (which now that it's ending PBSKids has an open timeslot it could fill with something like this), Pinkalicious And Peterrific, and PBSKids's weekend programming back in the 00s (which included book-adaptations ranging from George Shrinks to Anne Of Green Gables to Redwall) prove PBSKids can air a show that doesn't specifically teach science, history, math or reading but teaches moral lessons as long as it's based on a book. As for those who think Melissa McCarthy (who I think would be the absolute perfect actress not just because of her size, anyone who's read any Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books should see what I see) is too big a star to ""slum it"" with her own PBSKids show, well, ""you don't have to take my word for it"" but they got LeVar for Reading Rainbow despite him having been Geordi LaForge",StarChild413,1637140053

You name it, we've compared our dicks to it. But what, lady and gentle dicks, have we done to compare that pesky vajayjay? Nothing! That's what!  


So, introducing for the first time ever, the smart dildo, Smildo. The Smildo is an intelligent dildo with super sensitive sensors as well as hyper advanced ""grow and shrink"" technology. As the user uses the dildo they can simply adjust the settings to fit their preferred size in ALL aspects. Once the user is done making adjustments the Smildo starts collecting data. Everything is documented. Average depth, length, width, everything. Using this data, the user knows exactly their preferred dick size!  


Now, where do we go from here you ask. Well, we also have our new dating site... no, not a dating site... a FUCK site! Tinder and OKcupid and old fucking news and let's be honest, there's just simply too much bull shitting around the fact that people just wanna fuuuuuuuuuuuck.   
Our new fuck-site, aptly known as Smildate, uses those Smildo gathered numbers to match couples bases on one simple thing. Fuckability on the most scientific level.  


So, imagine you're rocking a hard 10 inches and you're checking out this total babe on Smildate. Turns out though, that tiny twat only wants about 4 inches at a time, move on. The thick Latin girl with a 10 inch SS or Smildo Score, could probably teach you a thing or two though.  


Now imagine you're rocking a hard 4 inches (more realist, am I right?). You're just scrolling through Smildate when someone SO HOT you would TOTALLY have skipped even viewing their profile because of the smelly mixture of her foxitude and your crippling case of small dick syndrome messages you ASKING FOR IT!

2780,Boy Scout troops for adults who need practical skills,"The Boy Scouts actually has a brilliant program for building a wide range of commonsense and practical adulting skills. Including money management, cooking, first aid, public speaking, emergency preparedness, and community service, and many, many more important life skills, hobbies, and interests. It's so well laid out that it would be hard to improve on it. It's the most comprehensive education at the lowest cost to the participant that I have ever seen. The BSA could make a huge difference in the country to offer its complete curriculum to adults who never got this practical knowledge as children. Separate troops for adults would be needed, though they could be co-chartered with child troops, and the ranks would need to have separate titles. It would give parents a meaningful advancement of their own while they are waiting for their cub scouts at meetings. Just as Eagle Scout represents a large body of practical training, so it carries weight on job applications, it would be brilliant if adults whose parents didn't put them in Scouts could earn an equivalent rank that would help their resumés. As well as make them less of a helpless idiot. Our society is currently low on achievement based awards for adults, low on organized social teamwork, and very low on the distribution of common sense skills, particularly to young adults. There are some ad-hoc efforts to offer basic skills, like sewing on a button, at community centers, and yes, you can look up anything on youtube, but the achievement-based delivery of the curriculum and hands-on teaching is a better learning method for most people.",benny-the-rennie,1636995957

2796,I am proposing a worldwide CE5 Meditation day. CE5 Meditation is a method of contacting extraterrestrials.,"Before I start, I'd like to provide some source material and background of the subject of my post.  Recently a documentary has been released titled: ""Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind:  Contact Has Begun.""  I will link a preview of this documentary here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRK6IA--Swk

As of this moment there are thousands of people venturing to peaceful places and practicing the CE5 protocols to make contact with extraterrestrial beings (or aliens if you prefer).   I will list the protocols here below. 

TERMS:
CE-5, Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind (Human initiated contact with nonhuman Beings)
HICE, Human Initiated Contact Experiences


NOTE: These steps can be followed by a solo person, indoors or outdoors, or by a group.


STEP 1: LOCATE/DESIGNATE AN APPROPRIATE SPOT FOR YOUR CE-5. Find a quiet and/or remote spot in your home, or outdoors. If outdoors, choose a remote spot, preferably away from city lights and with a full view of the night sky. CE-5 can be done during the day or at night. Night time is
usually preferable, as sky viewing for starships, flashbulbs, or other anomalies is done before, during and after your protocols, and of course, easier to spot against a dark sky. If CE-5ing indoors; after
your protocols, walk outside and look up into the sky if you feel compelled to do so. Sometimes, after a CE-5, you will see nothing in the sky, however instead, have an ET themed vivid dream or other experiences of the ethereal, spiritual, or benevolent high strangeness kind.


STEP 2: PREPARE YOURSELF FOR MEDITATION. At your designated spot, if in a group outdoors, place camp or lawn chairs in a circle and sit facing each other. If at night, be sure to wear warm clothes, and consider bringing a blanket or poncho. Have a flashlight handy for convenience
and safety. Sit up in your chair with a straight spine as much as you are able when meditating.
Preparations for your meditation can include breathing exercises, playing music, singing bowls, chanting, playing a prerecorded meditation, and other techniques. At this point, you may also state intentions as well or introduce yourselves to each other. (Most highly advanced nonhuman Beings are
telepathic. They can also feel your intentions, so staying heart centered and sincere throughout is key).

STEP 3: MEDITATION, STATE INTENTIONS (OUTLOUD OR INWARDLY). Start your meditation.
Meditate for at least 20 minutes. Use a guided meditation or meditate in silence. Remove all random thoughts and worries of the day and focus on a solo target; your heart chakra or 3rd eye. (the spot
between your brows.) Use appropriate instrumental music if it helps you to go into a deeper meditation. Your thought should be centered on one thing, such as your heart chakra, love, peace, and calm, joy, happiness, or cosmic expansion in consciousness (by focusing on the 3rd eye chakra).
The mood should be upbeat, happy, joyous, and peaceful.

STEP 4: FOCUS ON YOUR HEART CENTER. MENTALLY PROJECT YOUR PEACEFUL INTENTIONS AND INVITATION OUT INTO THE COSMOS. After your meditation, focus on the heart center. Mentally (or telepathically) project your intentions with friendship and love (such as asking the ETs to join you, or meet you half way in an effort to help heal the planet, humanity, or to help with spiritual self-development, understanding, universal peace, or even confirmation that they truly exist!.) You may also project your location if you wish. (Though not necessary, as they are telepathically advanced). After you have projected your intentions with sincerity, sit calmly, clear your mind of random thoughts or fears, and be open to receiving a telepathic message, visual responses, unusual or otherworldly sounds, or other mystic experiences or phenomena too varied in nature and type to list.

STEP 5: SCAN THE SKIES FOR ET CRAFTS OR VISUAL PHENOMENA. BE OPEN TO POSSIBLE TELPATHIC COMMUNICATION, or any other ET or nonhuman contact phenomena you may experience, even hours after your CE-5, or the next day. Repeat any of the above steps if you wish.

I apologize for my poor formatting ahead of time.  If a kind moderator would be able to help out, I would be most grateful. 

I feel compelled to mention the fact that like many of you, I'm just an average interested person... I'm 31, married, but always wondering what if thousands of people reached out in one large gesture to answer these existential questions we have.  The documentary I listed above shows many clips of CE5 meditation expeditions finding success in being visited by extraterrestrial beings.  We think of contacting them through the physical realm...through technology, machines, ect.  And until recently we have been missing the most valuable part that we ourselves and all intelligent beings share...it's not language, the ability to touch, or speak...it's consciousness.  Consciousness is our common ground, and to imagine the effect it could have if thousands of people joining at one time, with good pure intentions of curiosity I think would be truly monumental.  But I'm just a guy on reddit, some may label crazy but I felt compelled to make this post...what if we did something?  What if we made this happen?  A crazy idea I know...but we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

2800,A new idea for world leadership.,"So here's my idea. Political leaders should be ready and willing to put their own lives on the line if they're ready to declare war. Every government should be made up of 100-300 leaders with a commander at the top. These people are representatives of their populations as in a normal democracy. If these representatives don't follow the will of the majority of their population they have to answer to them face to face. In times of unrest and war these people are the spear head. They're the ones to take the risk of battle with the opposing country's leaders of the same number. If they're defeated the rest of the populace can choose whether they feel strongly enough about the conflict to enter into a full scale war. This system would require that only the strong, smart, and ready will lead. The general populations would also have to rise up and believe that they're the ones that hold the power. I believe that this would create an effect that would ripple through countries and economies in ways that we can't even imagine right now. Leaders would also be cycled out if they can't do the job. This would ensure that there's less corruption because not many would be in positions of power for long enough to do serious harm, and having to answer to your people would deter any shady dealings they have going on.",3trt,1636933625

but a very VERY long track, with magnetic accelerators, and the slightest of upwards angles... should be able to accelerate something fast enough to fire it directly into orbit. despite rocket launches going straight up when you see the countdown finish, tp actually achieve orbit you need to angle to basically 'throw' the rocket all the way over the horizon, something that should be easier with a shallower angle of attack. obviously the acceleration would need to be controlled so it didnt kill the occupants (it is a change in velocity, not the velocity itself, that kills), and serious heat shielding would be required to survive the friction from our atmosphere (probably even more than is required for reentry), but without needing engines, and the fuel to feed em, powerful enough to overcome earth's gravity alone the craft can be made far simpler, safer, and cheaper than current methods. all such a vessel would need is maneuvering thrusters, life support, a safe way to land (and considering the old apollo missions we already know how to handle that end of things), and whatever equipment is relevant to the current mission/objective.

we are never going to conquer space with current propulsion systems. and this entire concept wouldnt accomplish much more than making it a lot easier to get a toehold on local space... but that toehold can be a launching pad for all future endeavors.",Jardite,1636857751

2838,A fire alarm system that calculates evacuation routes based on the location of the fire(s) and instructs you when &amp; HOW to evacuate.,"Alarm systems know which smoke/heat/etc. sensors were triggered, so they can figure out where there's fire. For example, if you have Nest smoke alarms, and your kitchen smoke alarm goes off, the Nest tells you there's a kitchen fire. 

What if the alarm system not just told you where the fire is, but also calculated the best way to evacuate in real time? This would be especially useful in commercial buildings, where there may be multiple viable evacuation routes and a lot of people to evacuate.

For example:  
Scenario #1. You're in a hotel room on the first floor, there's a fire in the lobby but you can safely evacuate. The alarm system knows where your room is, and directs you to the emergency exit on the side of the building.  
Scenario #2. Same situation as above, except the fire is right outside your door, blocking your exit. The alarm system might tell you how to bust open the window.",Comprehensive-Ad3963,1636831692

2853,My gameshow concept," My idea of a game show is ""How dumb is your baby""

Everyone knows babies are stupid, so this show is based on this. Children between 6 months and 3 years old will be the contestants and will be asked general knowledge questions.

If they answer correctly then nothing happens but if they answer wrong they will get points. The baby with the most points will be the stupidest baby

This show mixes things up where u are rewarded for answering wrong.

The kid who answers the most correct answers will get something that is useful not to them but to their parents e.g. Prize money or Discounts on certain stores etc

While the dumbest kid who answered the most wrong will get something that is worthless for the parents but useful for the kid. I was thinking it would be cool if every episode had a different prize for example in one episode the kids get V-Bucks for Fortnite or in another episode the kids get a giant water gun. 

This way we would have a conflict of interest between the parents and kids which would make for some entertaining TV. Parents would have reason to want their kid to be smart than they actually are but being their stupid self in in the best interest of the kid.

How is this pitch ? I got this idea talking to a 3 year old kid who baffle me with his stupidity and lack of knowledge however I found his ignorance entertaining hence I would love to watch a show full of dumb children competing to see who is the biggest idiot.",fire-fox-7,1636790604

[https://www.pattammaro.com/freetime](https://www.pattammaro.com/freetime)

Word of mouth recommendations are powerful.

“Have you started watching \_\_\_\_\_\_?” “Have you eaten at \_\_\_\_\_\_?” These are very common conversations we’re all having these days with friends, family, colleagues, strangers in the elevator, etc.

More often than not, I either jot down these recommendation in my notes app, which get cluttered everywhere, or I completely forget to write them down altogether. When I eventually have a free minute and want to check out a new movie, podcast, or video game I struggle to make a decision. I recall having the conversation with a colleague about a recent movie he had seen on Netflix, but am unable to recall the specific film.

FreeTime is designed to quickly create lists to help track those different categories of things to do when you have free time.

Note, this is only a design. If I receive enough positive feedback, I’m going to look to develop for iOS. I would love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks in advance,

2974,A new kind of mobile app,"##I have multiple problems to solve:


*1. An ignorant population of people ill-equipped to handle real issues;


*2. A media conglomerate owned by multi cooperations feeding cherry picked poison;


*3. A bored population of professionals guarding their online activities in anonymity; and


*4. A gaggle of government leaders incapable of bipartisanship because 1. can't communicate properly because 2. is running wild while 3. is is protecting themselves and their reputations from harm. 


##Now that I've listed the problems, here is the crazy idea I would like to propose: 

An online platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, MySpace, Etc.) that is designed to bring certified professionals (in all fields of work and expertise) who spend time dicking around anonymously Reddit and other social media anyway (like muah), being believed by no one for the few claims they do make, together with the public whilst also continuing to secure anonymity. 


##This is how it would work: 

Account creation is open to anyone. It is an online social networking platform open to the public. We can all still bitch about whatever. But a feature of this platform is the _""verified professional/expert""_ tagline, where you opt to identify your knowledge base, professional/personal skills, anything you're a badass at and can use to make even a small difference by sharing. You then get those claims verified by a peer with an account who vouche for you. Your peer cannot see the subs you belong too, or the comments you make. Your expertise is simply verified. You can then go on your merry way learning from others as they share posts, discuss cool things, and argue with dummies on the internet. _""Do YOU have verified credentials Karen, hmmmmm?!""_ ^ Apologies to all the cool women stuck wih this name at such an unfortunate time. 


Anyway, you could choose to hide where you work, your name, etc and still pick a dorky useename like mine, but your lived experience would be a click away from proving your words have truth and an era where the internet has all but ruined it. You could talk one on one with someone verified as the CEO of a major corporation, dean of a renowned university, state or local Legislators, Congressmen and Senators. Wouldn't know who, or which one, just that you were talking to one.


It would be the first time that people at the top could truly have real conversations directly with those in the bottom ranks, but without any risk. People would learn so much, not only about who the people are behind these roles, but whether their character is worth votes. People in leadership and life alternating decision-making roles would hear directly from people impacted. 



Anyway, what do y'all think if you made it this far? I'm sorry there's no tl;dr, I felt the full context really mattered.",AshamedofMyFarts,1636534787

This would reduce rapes not just because it would induce fear into the public due to the gruesome punishment but also because it would also offer a legal way for sexually-deprived people to have sex without raping people (when thats otherwise their last resort).",CBT-ENJOYER,1636383854

3064,My dream and life project,"Hello everyone,

First of all I would like to say that Im not really good at English as it's not my firts language so I will apologise in advance for every spelling error or sentences that don't make much or any sense.

Secondly, this ""project"" its probably not going to happen in the short run. It is just an idea that would only hypothetically work with the support of big brands(such as red bull, adidas, nike, montana, and several others) because of the immense cost this project would have, that I have estimated that would be around 5-10 MILLION Euros. So for the moment this ""project"" will stay as a CRAZY idea with not much of a probability of being ever completed, yet I believe that somehow I will manage to complete this before the day I die as this has become my new life goal. 

My first experience as a skater was quite bad, even though I live a big city almost all skate parks were quite poorly made and where not that great and most of the time police would always get involved when I tried to skate in other places. So sadly I quite quickly quite the skateboarding scene, the same happened with parkour and bmx. After getting arrested for illegal graffiti I was escorted to the police station for tras passing and what not and I had a great idea... ""Great idea""...


Well the idea is quite simple honestly, to construct a ""Disneyland"" but totally dedicated to parkour/freerunning, skating, bmx, graffity and all underground activities or extreme sports that have a relatively large communities with no sense of union. 
The name of this ""Disneyland"" would be called ""Free City"" or ""Crime Free City"". 

Based on the idea that most of this activitys are illegal or are seen as such in many parts of the world, there're not many places where one can simply go and enjoy this kind of activities. But worry not in ""Free City"" you can enjoy this activities with people just like you who also enjoy them! The city will be mostly constructed of concrete and brick giving a idustrial, dystopian, ghost city felling to all districts. Full of places with opportunities to do tricks and jumps, every buildings inside will have hallways full of obstacles for freerunner to run free! Windows connected by zip lines to go from building to building! Some buildings close enough to make epic jumps from one to another! Massive towers for climbers to enjoy! A non functional subway and a train yard for graffiti artists to enjoy painting as they wish! 

I will be working on a 3D model of how I want it to look and all the ideas I have in mind, but sadly Im not very good at it so it will take some time. Once I finish I will share with you all how it looks and hopefully it will unite all people interested in this!

To make an incredibly long story as short as possible, in the last year I've gone through a divorce (partner of ten years, wife of two was cheating on me) and a whole lot of other shit. I struggle with mental health but I've been doing as much as I can to get the support I need.

Canadian, male, 30. I want to sell my house and gain well over 100k in profit, quit both of my jobs (one I've been at for 12 years, the other 1) and set aside a portion for a new downpayment on a house - and travel the world. I recently purchased a van that's been converted into a camper. 

I'd also set aside a portion for education as I've never done anything past high school. My plan would be to tour around Canada/USA in the van, then park it long term or something and fly over to Europe. Iceland is definitely in the books. I was thinking maybe even I could try working in different European countries on a short term basis while travelling. 

It's been a long dream of mine to see as much as the world as possible. Travelling is my greatest passion. I also wanted to write a book about my experiences as I go along. I would then eventually settled down somewhere, using the money I set aside to maybe try to get a house and maybe an education. The housing market is wild in Canada, but I want to reside somewhere near mountains.

My house right now is very affordable. Its a three bedroom two bath, not much of a yard but my mortgage and taxes come in under 900/month. My family has basically told me I'd never get that again.

I think all music should have another label totally seperate from genre to describe how it sounds. Its *tone*. 
Every song on an album could have it's own tone associated with it depending on how that particular song sounds (anrgy, happy, said, whatever)
Happy rock is very different than sad rock. Likewise, someone might like both rock and country, but only the happier songs of both.
If there was a specific label that was based on the specific song, regardless of its genre to describe it, it would be even easier to find music you like.

Currently I don't like country music, but I bet I would if I could find the songs that have the same *tone* as the music I like. And I am sure they are out there.

There could be a *tone* playlist with a mix of country, rock, metal, pop, and any other songs that share the *tone* you are looking for.

I keep seeing recipes for almond-flour bread, but every time I try, something goes wrong. I try to find stuff without using eggs, which some say flax seeds work, but with no luck with either not using eggs or making flax seeds work.

I have been meaning to try a few recipes for low/0 carb cheesecake and ice cream, but failing to make the bread over and over made me scared to try spending more money on stuff that may just not work for me. In fact, I failed the ice cream one multiple times as well. I don't need to go broke just from trying to make my own food, supposedly saving money on cooking for myself.

I think it would be cool to have a website where if you're looking for a way to make something, you can add and subtract ingredients for making it, if it's possible.

P.S. you'd think that if these recipes actually work, that with companies aiming to make all the low-fat products, zero drinks, no-sugar-added, and other stuff, there would be 0 carb versions of stuff as well.

Solution: Every time something is reposted, halve the amount of karma per upvote the post can earn. First time posted, full points. Second, half. Third, 1/4, etc. That way, people that spam previously successful posts merely to farm karma won't get nearly the payoff that they're getting under the current system.

Identifying content that has been previously posted isn't that hard. And in the case of a false positive, the redditor can always just contact a mod to explain what they've contributed to the piece to exclude it from repost classification.

3250,"Have only one website and company for all online social media, including status updates, chat, photos, videos, streams, games, posts, news and what have you","You might notice that YouTube is already a membership platform, an imageboard, a forum, a livestreaming service and a paid streaming service as well as a video hosting website. So basically, it already has the main features of Patreon, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Twitch and Netflix all at once. And Reddit also already has various chat room functionalities, I think.

So I thought: what's the point in having *so many different sites* when you could just have ONE? There's so many other sites that, in case you're completely overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content on the internet like most of it's users, and you're only using the most popular sites, you're gonna miss out on pretty much everything other sites have that aren't reposted to the popular site. Like, completely, even if you're looking for it (chances are you won't go searching any other websites for a particular thing). And they're so different, too. Like you might notice there are sites like...I dunno, VK or Hololive or whatever that have such unique...  
\*lost mind after minutes of going around the internet\*

Well look. If you have ADHD like me and pretty much only use a few social media at a time every so often, I don't think it'd be handy to have to keep every single website in check. Like, any more than like ten and the chances are that you'll soon be going inactive on some of them. So why not just have one? If there was only one all-encompassing social network and everyone on the internet was using it, everyone could have the benefits, functionality and community of every social medium at once. So nobody would miss out on anything if they didn't feel like going on other websites, their activity would be globally updated, and the company would probably be so large that there'd be updates in features and security left and right, and no competition. In fact, it would probably have all sorts of customisation and ""workspace"" features. Also, they'd probably be obliged to listen to all of the internet as a whole on whatever values they need to address.

Look I dunno, it just seems awfully convenient. Everything in one place, available probably like the founders of the internet envisioned. I'm kinda losing my mind so I won't say much more but yeah...like why not?

But due to a error in the VR system, he can't get out of John Cusack's mind.

3355,How to fix reddit.,"I am tired of turning to reddit only to see once again some self serving dishonest jackass like Ben Shapiro or Tucker Carlson or Bill Maher is being treated as an oracle of great significance. If I want to wallow in racist misogynistic bullshit, I don’t need Reddit’s help to find it. 

So what is the solution?

Start a sub-reddit called Harmful Misleading Propaganda. Then Create a mechanism whereby posts referencing creeps like Tucker Carlson, Hannity, Trump, and all the other liars causing harm and division, get transferred to this steaming cesspool of cowardice and fear mongering. Think of it as a sewage treatment plant for inter webs: sure there are bound to be twisted individuals who go there to savor the foul odor and wallow in the filth, but this who detox the rest of Reddit for those of us who want to our discussions to be reality based. 

Free speech would still be allowed and accountability would also become more relevant. The worst of the turds could be give awards each year or more frequently. Maybe we’d call them “The Stinkies?”

Yes, there would be kinks no work out but Reddit can continue to function as a mere echo chamber of the crap spewing forth from rightwing talk radio and cable “news” or we can be bold and find the courage to build a global community were honesty, reality and collaboration replace the senseless scapegoating and fear mongering that the oligarchs have become so adept at using to prevent us from building a better world together.

3360,Okay hear me out about the Universe…,"What if…

What if we are all just small parts of another person?

Like, we are humans on earth. We are very small and we, “life,” is the mitochondria 

Earth would be an entire cell that we all “live” in, that has all different parts that do crazy things.

Stay with me.

Now, our solar system, The Milky Way, is a small cluster of cells within another persons body.

And the entire “Universe” is the body of someone.

The reason we believe it is always expanding is because the person we are inside is still growing, and that the Universe is not infinite, they just haven’t stopped growing yet.

And when planets and stars die, those are cells dying.

And a black hole is clearing out waste from the “body.”

And the reason it is so dark in the universe is because the light from outside is blocked off by the skin of the person we are inside.

And people wanting to save the planet are just little parts of the cell not trying to die out and hang on!

And solar storms are nerve signals / nerve pain!!

And the “Big Bang” was really the “Big Bang,” and when the sperm met the egg, that’s when the “expansion of the Universe” started!!!

Y’all, I think I’m onto something so if you don’t hear from me just know they got to me. This shit makes too much sense.

3368,"A dog rescue with escape rooms called ""Pooches and Puzzles"". Anyone who adopts a dog receives a free escape room experience with the dog and gets to escape. People not adopting can still do escape rooms for a fee and take a rescue in the room.","Instead of just adopting a dog, why not make it a memorable experience for both while helping a pup escape?

Pooches and Puzzles offers a unique experience for everyone walking on two legs or four.  A full service dog rescue and adoption shelter mixed with 2-4 escape room experiences with varying difficulties provide a unique destination for people looking to adopt, thrill seekers, and the pooches themselves.  For a low adoption fee that supports the dogs, you will enjoy waived escape room fees for each adopted dog and owner, your new best friend gets to join you in the escape room fun, an official ""Escape Day"" certificate and photo.

Escape room participants not adopting pay a reasonable escape room fee for one low price that covers all levels of difficulty.  They also have the option to take a rescue on the escape room experience with them to help sniff out clues.  If they decide to adopt after solving the escape room, the adoption fee is waived.  Volunteers wishing to spend time or walk with rescue dogs are permitted in the shelter only and are subject to escape room fees.

Benefits:

*Escape rooms are still a fairly new and unique experience many people would like to try at least once.  

*Allowing the dogs to participate may be added incentive for people who are dog deprived.  

*An escape room is a more interesting destination than a traditional rescue shelter or dog pound attracting more people potentially adopting a dog.

*The dogs receive attention, exercise, and social skills and are more likely to get adopted.

*Non-adopter escape room participants who bring a rescue to the room are more likely to adopt.

*Escape room experiences attract larger groups of people to experience together and more potential adoptions.",sunghooter,1635680784

My SO said it would be tricky because people may try to take advantage of this. It would be a facility that doesn't re-hire. It would probably hire vet techs with actual medical experience too. This way there's also regular staff to help train new workers, if not having the on-site workers there long enough to train new people themselves.

3407,The Entire Labour Market is a Giant SCAM - we should fix it,"As mentioned in the title, the labour market (and the idea of employment as it exists today) is a giant scam. Why? Because you work, but you only get paid a small fraction of what that work is actually worth in terms of profit - most of the proceeds end up going to shareholders, the majority of whom are either obscenely rich people, financial companies, or both, instead of to the people who actually did the work.

That doesn't mean it has to be. The *concept* of jobs, a labour market, and employment is a good one; we're just doing it wrong. Here's what I propose instead:

All companies should have to be workers' cooperatives - wholly owned by their employees. That way, paying your workers more is exactly the same as paying your shareholders. Perhaps you'd start at a significantly reduced *monetary* rate in the beginning, having a portion of your wage paid in stock, until your ""buy-in"" \[paid in hours, not dollars, because requiring money from a prospective employee is super scammy\] is complete, or perhaps you'd just continually have a part of your wages paid in stock (though this could cause basically inflation but with the company's stock, so the first option is probably a better idea). After the initial buy-in/probationary period, you'd get paid a much larger portion of what your work is worth - because you're both an (equal or equitable - take your pick) shareholder \_and\_ a worker. 

Not sure if it'd be a better idea to allow quitting/fired employees to keep their shares or require them to sell them back to the company or to other employees. That'd probably be the sort of thing you hold a shareholder vote for, and... oh, the shareholders \_are\_ the employees? Sounds pretty fair and democratic to me. As shareholders, the employees would also be able to vote on other important decisions - if you wanted to be really radical, you could go so far as to make the structure directorless, with all important/major decisions being made by the employees (maybe at the start or end of your shift, everyone would vote \[probably electronically, for convenience\] on whatever major decisions need to be made) or by their directly-elected executives (CEO etc). This means management is forced to stay in touch with their workers, because at the end of the day the workers are collectivelly calling all the shots.

The best part is, that would also make it in employees' best interest to do a good job and not slack off, because the company's performance has a significant effect on their income/net worth. Not just at the discretion of management/executives - they can't just choose what the value of the company is, as that can be semi-objectively determined (by third-party auditing firms, if necessary; there's another thing you could hold a shareholder/employee vote on!).

This isn't an entirely foreign idea - there is some precedent. Employee share options exist, although they are optional and are weaksauce compared to this, as usually they are majority owned by people or firms outside the company - I believe it would be best to have \_no\_ outside shareholders, and not allow trading of the shares on the open market. That way, all the net profit (not including what the company uses to fund its own expansion) ends up going to the workers, the way it should. They did the work, so they should be the ones to reap the rewards.

As things are, the ultrawealthy are the ones primarily reaping the rewards, gorging on the fruits of our labours, while the workers who actually make it all happen are often struggling just to feed their families and maintain a roof over their heads. The capitalist system as it stands today is built on the historical and ideological foundation of serfdom and slavery, and it shows, but that doesn't mean it necessarily needs to be scrapped. 

Sometimes, a few tweaks are all it takes to turn a crappy system into an excellent one - maybe that's possible here, too. This doesn't have to happen from the top down, either - if you're running or trying to start a business, think about whether a workers' cooperative type structure would work for you and your people. It's okay if you can't go all the way - every little bit counts, incremental improvements still bring us closer to our goal, and you can lead by example by making them.",_re_cursion_,1635576463

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time now I have had recipes sitting about for hemp composite materials and no way to apply them in the real world. I have also been so in my head and afraid to ask for any help that I found myself further and further from my dreams of making sustainable construction materials that would sequester carbon into houses and structures that would last a couple of hundred years.  If I can get this project funded before December 31st I should be able to sequester anywhere from 5 to 10 people's yearly carbon footprint by the end of next year. While I would prefer some positive response I am prepared to hear the negative, there is nothing you could say that I had told myself for years as I was in fear of asking for help. If I could get anyone that sees this to share it with at least 5 people and they share with another 5 and so on. even if 1/10 people were to even consider helping me out with a couple coffee's worth of cash I could have this funded in no time. While this homestead project is to start research with a 5-year plan to see the efficacy of selling the construction materials vs having another person manufacture and sell my recipes.

3447,"The US is in dire need of investment in its infrastructure and social safety net. For this, new sources of revenue will be needed. Let's take a page from the book of the tyrants of old. Let's demand tribute from Canada.","[Tribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute) was a common diplomatic tool in the ancient world, but it has fallen out of fashion in recent centuries. If you were a small kingdom living next to a mighty empire, you would periodically send their ruler ""voluntary gifts"" to keep them from annexing your territory. Demanding, receiving, and paying tribute was just part of diplomacy. A single moderately-powerful nation might simultaneously receive tribute and give tribute. 

Well, the US may not have a strong social safety net, but we do have a superabundant military budget and power projection capabilities. Maybe it's time we started turning that hard power into some hard cash. That's right, it's time to demand Canada pay up. We need to demand tribute from Canada. 

Canada's current GDP is about $1.8 trillion USD. Historical tributes were often quite large. There were even [special taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danegeld) that had to be levied to pay for them. Thus, going by historical standards, we could demand say, $500 billion USD/year from Canada. Also, tribute often consisted of some payments in kind and were often meant to be a blow to national pride. Thus, we should also demand the entire annual Canadian maple syrup harvest as well.

That seems fitting for a proper modern day tribute payment. A $500 billion USD/year cash payment, and the entire maple syrup harvest. 

Why Canada? Well it's the obvious choice. They're a wealthy country of modest military power, and they're right on our doorstep. Consider an alternative, like Britain. Raiding Britain for failing to make a tribute payment would involve trans-oceanic supply chains. Plus they have nuclear weapons. They're also close enough to other powers that they might get involved. 

But Canada? We're literally their only land neighbor. Enforcing tribute demands would be cheap and easy. Plus, as a wealthy country, they have the economy to support large levels of tribute payments. 

I think we could reasonably expect to wring perhaps $500 billion USD/year out of Canada, plus the maple syrup harvest. Alternatively, we might cut out the middle man and go for a more in-kind form of tribute. Their tribute payment could simply be that any US citizen will have the right to receive free medical care at any Canadian hospital.",isleepinahammock,1635476651

3512,Human genetic modification is ethical*. Banning it isn't.,"\*if done correctly (keep reading?). Note: This idea is quite possibly certifiably batshit crazy. I've never heard anyone else talk about this side of the issue. Take me with a grain of salt here? Yes, there is an idea in there - it's down a couple paragraphs. This idea is so batshit it actually \_needs\_ that much preamble.

This is probably a very unpopular idea - I'm about 99.9% sure I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this one. Basically everyone I've talked to has had such an issue with it they haven't let me go into detail on *why* I believe this, though, so I kinda just want to get it off my chest. I'm going to guess you probably got angry just looking at the title. I get it; before, I would have felt the same way - but I've spent a long time thinking about this since then. Before you impulse-downvote me, I'd ask that you please look at my reasoning. *Pretty please, with a cherry on top?* It's pretty long, I know, but that's because I've spent over a decade thinking about this, and have basically kept it to myself. Maybe I have things wrong (I am human after all) but... I tried my best to understand the issue objectively, and that's all I can do. With that being said, here goes:

We're really handing the next generation a raw deal, as things stand. They're going to have a ton of problems to deal with: climate change, sea level rise, freshwater shortages, acidified oceans full of plastic, persistent organic pollutants everywhere messing with hormones, oil reserves running out, desertification of many regions, overpopulation, probably famines, and a lot more I probably haven't thought of yet. Maybe Kessler Syndrome in orbit, too?

They don't have a choice in the matter. We're bringing them into a world that us and the generations that came before us have made a royal mess of, whether they like it or not. They also don't have a choice as to what genes they get from us - they get our genes whether they like them or not. For a lot of people, that could mean their kids are getting genetic diseases, strong tendencies towards character flaws (though nurture also plays a role in this), physical deformities, and/or other problems. Even if a child gets lucky and doesn't have any of those issues, they could still end up being physically weak, not particularly intelligent, unattractive, clumsy, or having any number of other non-disease but still undesirable traits. Again, they don't have a choice in this - they're born the way they're born, and that's it. Think of it this way: imagine your parents could made you better in pretty much any way - healthier, longer-lived, stronger, smarter, prettier, less prone to injury, faster, and/or even just happier with life - but they chose not to, because they didn't want to for some reason. If you have a genetic disease - imagine if your parents could have chosen to ensure you never get that genetic disease, to make sure you were born healthy, but they didn't. How would you feel about that?

We could make our children stronger, smarter, quicker-learning, faster, kinder, more compassionate, less violent, more patient, less likely to cheat on their partners (yes, this is possible - if you're curious read about oxytocin receptors and arginine vasopressin receptors), longer-lived, healthier, resistant to developing diabetes, less likely to develop cancer, less susceptible to radiation, less prone to addiction, tougher, more resistant to pain, sharper-eyed, more ambitious, less anxious, happier, and *a lot* more. If we're worried about overcrowding, we could maybe look into how to slightly decrease sex drive, or even just make it slower for them to have kids (if it takes 2x as long to have children, maybe they won't have so many?). Maybe we don't know how to do some of those things just yet - but that's only because nobody's really trying right now, due to the fact we've pretty much just decided as a species not to ""do"" genetic modification. With enough time, money, and effort, we could figure out how to do all of those things safely, and make life better for everyone over the long run.

Obviously, there are reasons not to, as things stand - if only the rich had access to it, it would make inequality worse, and would almost certainly make the world worse rather than better. However, if **everyone** had access to it, then wouldn't that be fair and equal, and solve that problem? There is a way. We could heavily publicly fund / subsidize research to figure out how to do all these things completely safely, and then we could make ALL the different ""proven safe"" genetic modifications **available for free** (maybe under socialised healthcare, or maybe through a purpose-built program) to **any parents who want their child to have them**.

""But that'll be hugely expensive!"" I hear you saying already, and sure, you're right, it probably will be. There are at least two reasons that's not necessarily a problem (there are probably others I don't know about): Economies of scale, and increased lifetime productivity. Economies of scale are pretty simple - if you are only doing something a handful of times, each time is expensive because you have to do all the research and work to develop a process, all to use it only a few of times; if you're doing something a million times the cost of the research and setup (which you only really need to do once) is divided over all those million times, so each one ends up costing a lot less. Increased lifetime productivity is pretty simple too - if you have a population of happier, healthier, longer-lived, smarter, stronger people, they can and will get a lot more done over their lifetimes than we ever could, and that increase in productivity will probably pay for the cost of the program a thousand times over, so even if it's massively expensive... it should still be worth it.

It would be the ultimate in ""investing in our future"" - giving the next generation a huge leg up, and giving them a fighting chance of actually surviving the big problems on the horizon like climate change, pollution, acidification of the oceans, overcrowding, water shortages, and all the other problems we've (well not just us - past generations too) created for them. I would argue that NOT doing it is more unethical than doing it - we're effectively saying ""we could potentially make you able to live a happier, more productive, healthier, longer life... but nah, we decided not to to because we had feeeeeeeeeelings about it"". They don't have a choice in the matter even if we DON'T genetically modify them - they just end up getting our shitty unmodified genes whether they want them or not anyway - so it's not like the natural way is fairer. I'd bet you would have wanted to be born smarter, stronger, faster, healthier, longer-lived, and better-looking if you could... and so will they. In that way, I think NOT using the tools of genetics to (with the utmost of caution and care, making sure we do no harm) make life better for our children however we can is *straight up wrong*. It certainly isn't in accordance with the Golden Rule, which is \[paraphrased\] ""Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself."". If we would rather be better in some way, then the way I see it, we have an obligation to do our best to make that happen for our children.

If you've gotten this far, **thank you so much for taking the time to read all that**. Sorry it ended up being so long; I've been thinking about this for a very, very long time, and I've rarely talked about it because it really is a very unpopular opinion. It's been over a decade of mulling it over, in fact. I would be very interested in hearing what you all have to say about it; I hope you didn't find this topic uncomfortable, and I hope you found my thoughts on the matter interesting - or at least, not horribly offensive.

**As an addendum**, for certain groups of religious people, since I know you'll probably have a lot to say about this (which is fine, I totally understand): I don't actually think this is ""playing God"" at all. On the contrary, from that perspective, I think it could actually play an important role in being good stewards of the Earth - perhaps it's even something we're meant to do. After all, Genesis even says ""let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."" and ""Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it"". I'd say we are not taking good care of our planet; ""replenishing the earth"" could be a metaphor for using our (present) ability to alter life to repair our devastated environment (slowly and carefully). As we are right now, we've wholeheartedly failed to do what we were supposed to. Maybe that's a sign that our first job is to... fix ourselves so we can be better stewards, and perhaps try to undo some of the damage of the original sin. We are said to be the ""image of God"", the New Testament says that the Holy Spirit is inside all of us, and that Christ will return eventually (it's often said in 2000-ish years, which interestingly lines up pretty well with us developing the science of genetics). What if the whole idea is that **we** are supposed to *help* bring about the second coming, and what if the science of genetics was meant to play a role in that? I mean, it's often said that God/the Holy Spirit works through people according to His plan. I'd be interested in hearing what you think of my interpretation.",_re_cursion_,1635326839

3514,A backpack cooler that can cool both a sub sandwhich and drink on the go,"So this might already exist, but it's REAL NICHE. It's kind of a hiking or picnic idea, not really a long-term camping backback (since it only holds 1 sandwhich and 1 drink, and then is a regular backpack).

https://i.imgur.com/ZiojWbb.png

I drew this pretty quickly to illustrate what I mean. I think the chemical coolers (like icepacks, the gel kind) could be in turn kept cool by a mechanism at the bottom and the back of the bag. NOT near your lower back, away from the person. 

The chemical coolant bags can be replaced, you know in case one rips or something, but then again so can the tubing of the water cooler. The mechanism and water resivoir can also be replaced, but I don't think is would be by PC Gamer components (Razer hit me up ;) ). 

But it is a NICHE PRODUCT. If you don't make big sandwhiches at home to take with you in your backpack, this won't change your life. If you buy submarine sandwhiches before going to work or on a hike, you might like this. 

Other sandhiwches or food can fit in there. But, I don't know why you'd want a cold burrito or shawarma? I also wouldn't want to hike around with a little heater on my back, making my food warm? IDK, you do you, I can't tell you this design wouldn't keep food warm **but I do not recommend it**. 

Adding extra heat to the hiking exercise, even if you want a warm shawarma at the end of a big hike, might be a bad idea. 

But the cooling, to keep a COLD SANDWHICH COLD, might be worth it for the tiny amount of people I had in mind, by which I mean me.",Sachyriel,1635318078

3554,Simulation Hypothesis Petition,"Greetings Friends,

This petition is to get the attention of the being or beings responsible for creating and maintaining the ancestor simulation, data-collection program, or super computer processing network we call our reality.

Once we have their attention our goals should be as follows:

1. To sincerely thank them for giving us the opportunity to exist. To even be given a chance at something over nothing is miraculous. We are not ungrateful.
2. To collectively voice our disapproval for the methods of data collection being used in our current simulation and and an explanation of its purpose.

Once contact has been established we should ask to start an open dialogue with the being or beings with the goal of improving the simulation so that it will work for everyone. One that respects the will and consent of sentient beings.

It should be designed for life to thrive instead of one rife with unnecessary cruelty and suffering. The data these beings are collecting from this simulation is no justification for the wanton brutality and callousness seemingly built into the very fabric of the program.

We did not consent to this and neither did any other being that was forcefully pulled from the nothingness and made to bear the full weight of existence and consciousness. All we ask is to be given a choice, or at the very least some answers. We deserve that much.

Respectfully,

A Conscious Program

It’s working splendidly. Think this can gain ground in the corporate world? 


I just hate email. It’s unproductive, mostly unimportant and not collaborative.

3612,Improve soccer and its tiebreakers in knockout competitions (e.g. FIFA World Cup's final stretch) so that it can be more beautiful than ever!,"1. The ""maximum of 5 substitutions per match"" rule should be upgraded to ""maximum of 3 substitutions per half on group matches; maximum of 4 substitutions per match on knockout matches, with 2 more allowed during extra time"" so that there can be more goal-scoring opportunities! (As of now, this arrangement will cease to apply after 2021.)
2. In extra time, there should be a 10-minute break between halves in order to reduce player injuries! (As of now, extra time periods are intensive.)
3. In penalty shootouts, kicking players should have 30 seconds to kick the ball into the goal post so that the sense of urgency to score goals can be truly invoked! (As of now, they're untimed.)
4. If both teams have scored an equal number of goals - or neither has scored any - during the first 5 pairs of kicks, penalty shootouts should proceed to sudden death - the first team to score a goal immediately wins! (As of now, penalty shootouts without a team ahead on goals after the first 5 pairs of kicks continue on a ""goal-for-goal"" basis - the team that scores a goal unmatched by its rival wins.)
5. If a match is a tie on penalties after 10 pairs of kicks, the winner should be decided by drawing lots so that soccer broadcasts stop wreaking havoc on television schedules! (As of now, the practice of drawing lots to decide winners of tied matches in knockout competitions was discontinued with the introduction of penalty shootouts; which can require more than 10 pairs of kicks to produce a tiebreak.)",Windows9xSeriesFan,1635035802

Ok....

The main point is being missed.....once we catch these pathetic scum for humans then Basically 75 years MANDATORY jail time then we will never have to see them literally till the day we die.
So basically if we put this law of ROBBERY 75 years MANDATORY then it looks like this...

100 thieves that remember ALL had and are going tp rob the store .....but if we implemented this wacky law then this is possibly what would happen to robbers mindset. 

60 of them decide wisely that the risk of robbing the convenient store for 1,400 bucks is not worth the 75 years MANDATORY if caught 
40 of the people left think hard about it..... still move forward and rob the store and 20 get way with it and the final 20 actually get caught and now placed 75 years MANDATORY jail time and we always would show this on TV to scare the next 100 criminals and now from 

100 thieves.....
80 decide its not worth it....

3647,Proposing a concession between pro-choice and pro-life groups where they both sort of win and lose,"Story in advance, this is kind of depressing low-effort thought experiment on how to find middle ground between the most ridiculously polarized subject. I hope it sounds like a terrible idea to whoever reads it:

The main change in the game is making it illegal for fetus to die during the procedure that separates it from its biological mother. Extensive legal tests developed to dole out punishment with combination of jail time and extreme fines, since big money will be funding research to legally unlock earlier extraction times and bigger paydays.

The minimum gestation time to allow procedure shall coincide with then current earliest 75% (not too solid on a percentage) surviving natural early birth and successful extraction cases, who grow and reach above-average development milestones in mental, physical, and social tests administered by an independently audited organizations. Also laws put in place to respect standards of facilities, and funding is tied to these ratings. This forces cooperation of both groups, and criminalizes negligence in any part of the development of the person.

Procedures to be handsomely paid for by the state, but all medical practitioners and research sponsors become liable for a lost fetus. Payment to medical teams provided in scale with risk; though if unsuccessful, only the medical team on site has legal fees reimbursed. Fines are non-negotiable and scale to inflation and total assets of research sponsors (corporations with deep pockets)

You incentivize pro-choice to push development of life-saving science to save embryos from mothers who do not wish to host the development of a fetus. It incentivize pro-life to make a child unwanted by their biological mother reach successful adulthood. Finally, it incentivize both groups to want what is best for the development of a person and avoid the death of a fetus during a procedure.

For example - we buy 5 to 15 different products for cleaning, moisturizing, healing, glowing, and relaxing our bodies. We use at least 3 to 6 different products on our hairs, face, and body. These products are made from chemicals and are added preservatives and perfumes/fragrances as well. All together each product we use carries 10 to 20 different chemical ingredients.

Our body consumes 60% of these chemicals which results in -

Skin issues like - irritation, redness, acne, eczema, psoriasis, fungal infections, redness, itching, excessive dryness/oiliness, acne, blemishes, etc and

Hair issues like - split end, hair fall, dandruff, hair thinning, baldness, scalp itchiness, redness, excessive dryness/oiliness, eczema, patches, etc.

For each issue written above we use different products, we invest a lot of money, time, and efforts to get our health back.

What if I tell you that our one single product of our bodypack can provide you with cleaning like soap/shower gel, conditioning like your moisturizer, smoothness like your lotions/creams/gels, protection from UV rays and tanning, provides glow and can also start healing our all above written issues of skin with the first application of 5-10 minutes itself and you don't have to invest your time, money and efforts for keeping your skin clean and glowing in the whole day.

Would you be surprised? Well, it's now true actually.

Our one-body pack can treat everything so that you don't have to invest in your soap, shower gel, body lotions, creams, moisturizers, sunscreen, night gels, and with time you will not need perfumes and deodorants as well.

Each product provides multiple results at the same time.

These herbs when washed don't harm the quality of water drained into drainage unlike the chemical products washed after being used by us.

We save our immunity, our money, our efforts and we preserve the water from getting polluted too.

I've heard that insurance companies have a funeral payment service, but that would be a little different. You will be able to choose the method of burial, coffin, casket for ashes, and add your wishes. I also think you can write a conclusion on the website. Since prices for services will change over time - I see it as a cash certificate to pay for the funeral. The main purpose of the site is not to make life difficult for your loved ones after death. So they won't be disturbed by funeral companies and won't cash in on people's mental state.

Perhaps there is a similar service in your country? Would you order a funeral for yourself? It is very interesting to know everyone's opinion",Torgash_BTC,1634845674

This charity crowdfunding theory is something I thought of randomly...... will it work....who knows....,"The charity is simple, permanent, Perpetual and can be applied as much and as fast as the American citizens want.

The idea around this formula of crowdfunding is to create trust and use love as our weapons as we make the USA a better society as we create the biggest wealth redistribution our Nation has ever seen.  The goal is to complete the most campaigns in 1 calendar year . Each campaign completed will equal ONE American to recieve 100,000 dollars cash.

All 50 states will using the SAME exact crowdfunding formula simultaneously and in competition.  Below the example; 

Pretend 1 Million citizens download this charity app and now Florida starts..... from the 1 million FLORIDIANS inside the app when 20,000 Philanthropic Floridians donate 5 bucks at 9am then ALL 20,000 are disqualified this particular campaign and from the remaining 980,000 Floridians that did not donate then ONE is randomly selected and recieves 100K cash and that completes 1 charity Crowdfunding campaign..... all 1 million Floridians all return to the app and they simply wait....example at 9am 20,000 citizens stepped forward and donated 5 bucks and disqualified themselves so basically at 10am they are broke and do not have another 5 dollars.....they now do not donate and just wait from the 1 million for 20,000 Floridians to step forward with 5 dollar donation and again a campaign is completed and from the 980,000 Floridians that did NOT donate then one is given the 100K cash and everything resets all 1 million returns to app and they all wait until a very brave and philanthropic 20,000 Floridians step forward with a 5 buck donation to complete the 11am campaign.....

This formula and theory would be happening individually in all 50 states in the USA at the same time..... the goal is to complete the most campaigns....so example.... lets use the 1 Million people that live and mandatory join the state they live via GPS example CALIFORNIA; from the 1 million Citizens of California at 9am they wait until 20K step forward with 5 dollar donation = campaign complete...... all 1 million return to app and at 10am from the 1 million citizens of California they wait until a brave philanthropic 20,000 step forward with 5 bucks donation.....

This would create the biggest wealth distribution that the United States of America trully needs for a more balanced and financially inclusive society that should result in elevated happiness levels accross the nation.",BigPapiPR83,1634793070

Yeah they don't need the money, but they probably aren't going to keep it going if there is no profit for them.
Once someone hits the wealth threshold they would likely just shut down their corporations, leaving many people out of jobs and removing something (probably) crutial from society.

Instead, why not limit the amount someone can inherit to like 1 billion, or 500 million, or even 100 million?
That way the big time CEO's can continue to feel good about their obnoxious hordes of wealth and participate in their race to see who can get the richest fastest, and their children can still inherit a huge amount and live luxuriously, which I assume is apart of the reason they want so much money on the first place (to pass on to their family)

You can buy seed packets at the grocery store, hardware store, or online. You can plant raw peanuts, green onion roots, potato eyes, and avocado pits. Anything that will grow something edible is better than systematically turning over our very sustenance to mega corporations. Stick seeds in municipal planters, flower beds, and parks. Adopt an esplanade or freeway berm along with your neighbors. Stick seeds in vacant lots - in 50 days or less you (or anyone who finds it) can be eating fresh greens. Sow sunflowers in depressing abandoned spaces. Plant a chestnut, walnut, pecan or fruit tree that the neighborhood can harvest. Grow a pot of green onions on the windowsill at work and share them with people to add to their lunch. Most office parks, dorms, and apartment buildings have some kind of green space, and spending 15 minutes out of your lunch hour tending a vegetable patch positively will make a difference. It may sound daunting to dig up a grass patch and plant it, but it is really not that hard. Just drive to your office building on a Saturday with a couple of coworkers and dig and plant it, then the tending is pretty easy. Any place that already pays for an automatic watering system should be happy to be watering vegetables. In the highly unlikely instance the building will not allow a tenant-maintained community garden, you can still container garden. If they pay for landscape plants, try to convince them to landscape with colorful vegetable plants like purple kale or amaranth. If you work at a place that is well-funded, like a hospital, circulating a request for popular support ought to get the doctors and donors on board to basically tell the building manager to put in a garden for the staff to plant.

- A non-playing person or group - the audience, a judge or panel of judges, or some combination thereof - is who decides which player is eliminated each week.

- Players who are eliminated don't actually leave the show.

- Results of elimination votes have zero effect on the game while it is in progress.

- Eliminated players are simply rendered ineligible to win, and cannot be voted for/against in later rounds.

- Players are not informed of vote results until the finale.

This is an interesting idea to me, as it allows the audience to see how all of players might grow and develop through the course if the show instead of only being able to observe the winning players.

Here, it's very possible that someone who is seen as a total asshole or incompetent in Episode 1 could end up redeemed in later episodes instead of having their game simply cut short due to their poor early-game performance.

You could even have a secondary ""fan favorite"" vote, for a consolation prize, at the end.",IsraelZulu,1634667782

How can I get a vial of vaccine?

3859,Ban Haircuts in Congress,"From my Master's of Government essay regarding inefficiencies of the legislative branch. (that I likely just failed)  


Therefore, there must be an indicator for the voting public that their elected representatives occupy their positions of authority in pursuit of retaining such status, apart from legislators’ claims to contrary notions.  I propose a visual indicator.  Prohibit the cutting, removal, and significant physical alteration of all hair (including the use of dye) which naturally grows on the head and face for each and every elected official in the legislative branch beginning with the commencement of their election campaign, and restrict their use of head coverings and hats to outdoor environments only.  Not only would this prohibition potentially dissuade individuals seeking and retaining such positions in pursuit of vanity, but it would also serve as a visual demonstration of the enduring commitment of each and every elected official while they remain in office to responsibilities beyond their own image.  The ever-evolving appearance of elected representatives would encourage their constituents to view their candidate from a temporal perspective, rather than one based solely within their rhetoric which may be altered as easily as a haircut.  Additionally, it would serve to warn constituents of their representatives’ self-perpetuation of political status by plainly displaying the duration of their presence in Washington DC, away from the populations they claim to represent.  

Once the attractive, doe-eyed man or woman of Congress begins to more closely resemble the disheveled and graying throngs of long-haired and bearded men and women of the legislative branch, they will likely be encouraged to reevaluate their state’s representative in conjunction with the expectations of legislative efficacy guaranteed during their respective campaigns.  They won’t be voting for their desired caricature of the ideal representative, they will be forced to consider whether conservative Merlin or liberal Baba Yaga truly reflects and achieves what their campaign platform, elevated by their constituents, seeks to accomplish in DC.  If these individuals display only the passing of time through the deterioration of their appearance and fail to contribute meaningfully to legislative action, they bear the risk of being replaced by more attractive and persuasive contemporaries who are believed by their supporters to be better suited to assume the graying mantle and bring about concrete and meaningful direction in the governance of their nation to the detriment of the comfort enjoyed by many through maintenance of their own personal appearance.  Thus, cooperation and bipartisan reconciliation would be much more attractive to members of Congress in the pursuit of retaining their positions, lest the mention of their collective conjures images of senile curmudgeons out of touch with reality rather than a reflection of the humble and aged wisdom required to collectively legislate in the context of a democratic society.",InternationalYear232,1634495245

This *rise* I have mentioned, is the rise of concern over LGBTQ+ (I don't know any more of the acronym but I know [there's more](https://youtu.be/dfHrXsGJ8mo)) rights. I may not bring fourth a solution to all problems, but I have devised a solution for at least one....

**Public bathrooms**.

Yes, the place you [piss](https://youtu.be/HKVoN-SjZ-Q) and vape.  
There are concerns that those who may identify as something contrary to their biological sex are not provided the option, when in public, to choose the bathroom they want, as they are biologically of the opposite sex. I suppose there may be other reasons, but I have yet to hear or think of any more so I remain ignorant. Please feel free to educate me in the comments.  
Anyway, this shall cease to be a problem and the debates can end. You may be asking yourself, ""*how does that solve anything*,"" and I have an answer. How you orient yourself will no longer be contemplated while going to any public bathroom. You will no longer be held back by the heavy chains of societally built gender constructs. This solution is soundly based on science and easily adaptable, as language and societal barriers are easily hurtled and anyone can understand this change.

I bring to you, my fellow Redditors, a [progressive](https://youtu.be/-vQQiEOTrXE), innovative, and perhaps even funny resolution.

The penis and vagina rooms.

There shall be no more discrimination on the basis of sex as you go relive yourself in either the penis or vagina room, just look in your pants if you're wondering where to go.

I, personally, am a huge advocate of promoting and implementing this new structure in schools. ""Men's/boy's ~~restrooms~~"" (to be replaced with penis rooms) and ""woman's/girl's ~~restrooms~~"" (to be replaced with vagina rooms) will have giant signs of the required genitalia hanging from the ceiling, easily directing you to your destination.   
As stated, no matter if you're German, Turkish, Nigerian, Canadian, Chinese, Lithuanian, or even my pal Tyler- his pecker is so small you can barely see it (don't ask how I know), you understand and are guided by solid science to which room you are to enter to take a leak, not by society or in fact anything else. Just science.

Thank you for your time and pains, I hope you have comprehended and are digesting my proposition.

To pay for expenses, the original home-owner is allowed to create shares, and sell them to the tenant.

3956,A chess game where players start off by taking turns to position their pieces anywhere they want on the board.,"Instead of starting with all the pieces in their correct spots, you start with an empty board.

A coin then gets flipped and the winner chooses whether to go first or last.

Whoever goes first puts a single piece of their choice anywhere on the board. The opponent does the same until all pieces are on the board **except the kings**.

I imagine the piece-placing process will be pretty intense because both players will be trying to put their pieces in strategically advantageous spots based on where their opponent is placing their pieces.

Once the pieces **(except the kings)** are all in place, the game is played with normal chess rules.

Whoever goes first during the placing process will be at a disadvantage because their opponent will be reacting to where they've placed their pieces - but will be at an advantage afterwards because they get the first move.

The whole board would be like a bloody massacre for the first few moves because I imagine people would generally place their pieces in either attack or defence positions. 

Once the game starts, players have 6 moves to place their king. Placing a king will take a move. If a player hasn't placed their king after 5 moves, they MUST place it on the 6th move.

Winner is whoever takes out the opponents King.

3997,A Bottom-Up instead of currently prevalent Top-Down structures in Politics/Democracies/Constitutions.,"Two recurring problems in currently prevalent democracies in the world are:

* The politics/power is not accessible to the average person. By which I mean that for most people it's not really a practical or realistic goal. Only certain kind of people go into and succeed in Politics(you know which kind), AND you need lots of money to be able to win elections.

* The choices of candidates is constrained heavily by the Top-Down Political Party structure. There are too few relevant parties, to begin with(most democracies are effectively two-party systems for the most part). And those parties candidates are constrained by the party ideology and direction, which is set by few men at the top of party leadership. This severely constrains the diversity of political thought and proposals, which could have been otherwise possible.

A Bottom-Up approach:

The idea is to create groups of 5-10 people, with each group voting and selecting their representatives for the next level. Then at next level, the same process repeats(ie groups of 5-10 are formed and voting happens), until you get the numbers for Senate/Congress. 

The groups need not remain the same every election and can be randomly constituted each time. To eliminate fraud, coercion, bribes and corruption, anonymous voting is to be implemented at all levels of the process, including at the Senate/Congress.

Coupled with this, is to have a Presidential System, where any number of candidates can stand in election, and after the results are announced, any candidate can, support or transfer his/her vote to, another candidate. They can also however withdraw their votes or support, anytime before the next elections. The candidate with the highest number of votes, at any given time is deemed President.

This kind of Presidential System would allow for much diversity of choice during elections. Because multiple people from the same party can stand for elections, and tthat there is no condition that a candidate has to get a majority of votes, people wouldn't merely not vote for their preferred candidate just because they think that he/she has no chance of winning. They would know that even if their preferred candidate doesn't stand a chance to become a President him/herself, there is a considerable chance of him/her playing a crucial supporting role in someone else's Presidency and thereby having a say. So, people's preferences would be better captured in the Political System.

I think that the Bottom-Up approach to select Senate/Congress, is far better than the current democratic systems. Few salient points why I think so:

*No corruption with regards to Party fund donations.

*Eliminates the need for all the expenditure/spending done in election times.
Eliminates the significance and thus destroys the phenomenon of fake news in Election context.

Will provide much higher voter turnouts, as you will be voting in a group of just 5-10 people, so will be much more motivated to vote, as the impact of your vote is much more obvious, explicit and visible to you, AND most importantly, you stand a chance(like everyone) for getting selected for the next level, and ultimately for the Senate/Congress seat.

* As a result of so many iterations(a population of 10 million will have around 5 levels of voting), it will definitely increase the quality of people ultimately selected for Legislature many folds!

* One counterargument is that with no 'career' possible in Politics and people getting elected probably for just one time, they will perform poorly. My response to that would be to take a look at every second term of a US President.

* Will be much more democratic in selecting the Legislature, as now one wouldn't require a grand scale funding and advertising, and a compromise in his/her moral principles, in order to get selected. In short, any decent and deserving person among us, can be selected.

* In the current system, people have little option as Political Startups are just not that easy. To much extent, I think this problem will be rectified.

* There will be no Party High Command culture and thus this new system is highly democratizing and decentralizing.

Problems/Criticism of this approach:

* This will be immensely expensive and nightmarish to execute - I agree. Two things can help. One, is to exploit the administrative/political structure to reduce redundancy. So, we can have this approach to select County/City/District level Senate/Congress. At the end of it's term, these Senates/Congresses selects, amongst themselves, the members for State level Senate/Congress, and that in turn, selects the members for national level Senate/Congress.

Second, is to replace the bottom and top level of this process by lottery. Why lottery? Because we will be hitting two targets with just this one thing. We want just want 'good enough' members for the Senate/Congress. More important is to keep them from arrogance and corruption. Lottery will induce humility in them and reduce the feelings of 'pride' and 'arrogance' which potentially lead to corruption of mind.(You can also watch this TED talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm75Fz6D5nA)

* Each round of elections exaggerates the power of the group with a slight numerical advantage, and having multiple rounds keeps exaggerating that even more. - Yup that's a problem, agreed. One thing we can do is to have reservations based on any criteria deemed important and on which basis, considerable discrimination exist in society. So, it could be race, caste, class, gender, religion, etc. 

Second thing we can do is to make it mandatory for the President's consent, for every law/bill passed by the Senate/Congress. Because President is being elected directly and NOT by the Bottom-Up process, the aforementioned effect will be neutralized.

4005,We should change the tax system from the current general tax pool to taxpayer elected funding.,"Alright so I got a little high last night ..keep in mind I have no idea how the tax system works.

It seems that right now we pay our taxes and it all goes into a black hole which is the government. We don't know what we paid for or where it went. What if every year when we do our taxes, we select where we want our individual taxes to go for the next year?

For instance, a certain percentage, maybe 50% would go to the ""black hole"" where it would be treated as taxes are today to ensure there is a baseline of funding across the board. The remaining 50% however could be allocated by individuals into areas of the government they care about. If you're very pro military put that 50% into national defense. Or 20% into national defense and 30% into education and so on. This would allow an individual to vote with our dollar and fund areas we believe warrant our individual support. I think this could also increase transparency to some degree since the government would essentially have to lobby us on why certain areas are deserving of our hard earned money. Politicians could publish a breakdown of how they'd want taxes to be spent so supporters could align with them and their endeavors if they wanted to.

This could potentially evolve into taxpayer funded campaigns instead of special interest groups buying up Washington or even the ability to directly fund initiatives such as renewable energy infrastructure or a specific nasa mission you care about.

Yes it would be difficult to establish the underlying moral principles behind such a test, and yes conservative Americans would probably assassinate me in my own home for coming up with the idea, but seriously, just think about it.

I mean, why not? Such an exam could be established by scientific data on the different aspects of parenthood, and by the democratic voting of qualified chosen scientists. And if we somehow could manage to make such an exam as neutral and ideologically-free as possible, as well as if we totally forgot all about angry southern Americans, this could in theory be a wonderful idea.

4037,The Beauty Index," 

While beauty is subjective, it is also statistically measurable.

If we take a large set of photos of different people, use a tinder-like app to make users compare 2 faces and select the more attractive one, then take the photos with the highest percentage of selection, plug into an ai, find the most commonly appreciated features (account for multimodal as well), then construct the statistically perfect face.

Then we can judge anyone's facial features by comparing their percentage of similarity to the perfect specimen.

This can be also applied to calculate the opposite-sex multiplier, so we can approximate how much our hormones influence our perception of beauty.

Then we take the trend of the opposite sex multiplier over time to get the horny graph and therefore predict the growth of the porn industry and invest accordingly.

Profit.

The British created the estate of Israel with the help of the US, which legitimized it by recognition. Why couldn’t the same be done for the Palestinian people? Many countries in the Middle-East are sympathetic to Palestine while at the same time depising Israel, so why not get together and form a new Palestinian micro estate, somewhere else?

There are of course many downsides that come with this idea. One of them is the fact that the Palestinians then wouldn’t have any historical connection to the ’new’ land. So a best case scenario for them would of course be one where they both got the peace they wanted, as well as getting to stay in the region. This doesn’t seem to be possible though, since Palestina and Israel just don’t seem to be able to live side by side; and since they’re the minority in the region, this could hypothetically be a good solution.

The hardest part would probably be to get the Middle-Eastern countries to be willing to donate the land, and sacrifice the resources necessary for such a grand scale plan. This could hypothetically work though, if enough motivation could somehow be generated. Even non Middle-Eastern countries could help out with the funding, and would probably ethically be forced to, so as to not come out as unsympathetic to such a politically relevant conflict.

PS: I think that we sometimes forget that the word ’hard’ isn’t a synonym for the word ’impossible’. Crazy ideas are sometimes the ones that actually make a difference. I am not naive to the complexity of a problem like this one, but we literally splitted the atom, so I see no reason why peace in the Middle-East should be an impossible feat to accomplish.

yes i get a place to sleep and electricity but thats just the base line for me to live and work in a society

so every district should require its employers to have a ""median"" pay on top of normal pay for workers hous

so for example if chicago's average cost of living is say $2500 a month for the basics. than every single employer operating and hiring within chicago should have to pay each employee $2500 each month right off the bat, PLUS normal wages for worked hours.

and if full cost is to much, at LEAST 1/2 cost

most jobs would actually be worth working if you knew at least 1/2 of your bills are already covered before your normal pay even starts each month.

It’s not like one system works best and the other is shit…. The truth is they both start great and go to shit quick on their own. They should be working together instead.

Maybe I’ll work to gain for myself for a few years with a business idea I’ve toyed around with…. Okay that was fun, now I kinda want to feel like a part of a team again working towards something bigger than myself.

I think it could work similar to electricity…. Direct current works, but it’s inefficient, dangerous, costly:

Alternating current works like a boss. Let the citizens be free to choose and free to change their hand when they feel like it.

The chamber varies on land area available but will be approximately 3 meters deep but may be tweaked after research for optimum evaporation within a day. Water gets in by having a tube with a valve into the sea. The tube has fine mesh to prevent other things apart from water getting in.) which we then condense/cool with sea water which we pump into a higher reservoir as a saline water battery. The now fresh water will be collected in a reservoir which will be connected to piping and be pumped inward into other reservoirs(the longer the distance and what not there will be additional pumps also powered by pumps. All solar energy required would preferably be generated by solar panels.This water together will imported waste soil from water treatment plant will be used to cultivate forests and the sahara as well as provide for green house to tilt crops there and grow algae for oil which will be stored in the special reservoirs.

4222,Pro-choice and Pro-life movements are really just two sides of the same coin. Instead of bickering and finger-pointing they should just work together to solve the issue,"I am sure everyone can agree that it is in everyones best interest to get the number of unwanted pregnancies down to zero. However, Pro-life and Pro-choice movements seem to come at it from different perspectives and I think it would be better it both of them work together to actually reach a conclusion.

Pro-life people will tell you that you should not get an abortion because the fetus is alive and it is therefor immoral for you to abort the child. Their usual conclusion is that if you do not want to have kids, then limit (or abstain) from having sex, otherwise you should be responsible for the consequences and so it is in your best interest to persevere through it and put your life together so that you can prepare for the child.

Pro-choice people will tell you that it is a woman's right to choose and that she should be able to decide where she can get an abortion or keep the child and is the only one who can make the final decision. They will say that they fetus is not alive yet (with varying opinions on *when* the fetus is alive) so one has not committed any moral transgression by getting an abortion. Their usual conclusion is that it is entirely up to the women to decide whether an abortion is right for her or not (and that if so, she should be able to get one).

*Note: I have obviously generalized and summarized the two view points for the sake of simplicity. It is obviously more nuanced than that by now but you get the point.*

I summarized both viewpoints to show that both sides are trying to solve the same problem but are going about it in different ways. Like I said, I think it would be much more productive if both sides of the debate got together and negotiated what the best way to reduce (and hopefully eliminate) the number of ""unwanted"" pregnancies so that we can quit this nonsense and move on.",Y1l8,1633558138
4223,Have prisons become legitimate companies which can hire ex-cons when they get out.,"Also help them with housing, etc. 

One of the biggest problems for ex-cons is finding a job after they get out. Usually they go back to crime because of this.

Instead, why not use the jobs they already do in prison as “degrees” they can use when they get out, still working for the prison (company) but getting a normal wage instead?

I feel like a LOT of cons would really think twice about going back to “street life” if they knew they had an immediate solution as soon as they’re out. Isn’t the goal of prison to re-integrate people into society? I really think it could help, and in addition be a nice deterrent. People usually turn to crime out of necessity…",Lokolooks26,1633556229

I've seen media that demonstrates flaws and injustices in capitalism (Hunger games, The platform, Elysium, Squid Games, almost all of the cyberpunk genre lol) but I've never seen anything that demonstrates what I would view as a viable alternative, its possible thats because no viable alternative exists but I would be interested in seeing one portrayed at least.

2) When you are expected to pay off your current loans.

3) A mathematical formula that, when the bank inputs the loan amount, spits out a probability distribution with x being the amount of time taken to pay off the loan, and y being the probability of paying off that loan in exactly x time.

Hyper is like the anime Dragon Ball Z or the Marvel vs Capcom fighting games or Devil May Cry action games. Fluid is more like the fight scene between Naruto and Sasuke, between the Tekken and UFC games or Dark Souls. The idea is whether or not it matters how big the attack is vs how important the details of the fights are. Bad examples of hyper fighting would be like seeing a still image, a bunch of fists or blades, and the main character just phasing in different spots on screen, while I can't think of any examples of ""bad"" fluid fight scenes, though I would say that I originally wasn't into Rurouni Kenshin making a big deal about every sword swing (finding it boring back then) before I grew appreciation for it.

4467,Hooli ball.,"Like basketball, but with a field twice as big and four movable hoops with no backboard and different height adjustments and 2 balls.

The starting team gets too assign the values they want to each hoop (from 1pt to 4pt) and sets them up however they want on the field. There are no “sides” for each team, so everyone is constantly spread out on the field. You can have a hoop in the middle if you like. Anywhere you wish.

Though 2 balls are in play, if one ball goes through a hoop, the second one must go through the same. If the second one goes through another, the points are deducted. If both go through the same hoop, 1 extra point is awarded. Once a ball has gone through a hoop, it is ignored until the 2nd one is scored. This means everyone focuses on the remaining one.

The defending team doesn’t know which hoops are worth what, and has to try to stop the other team from scoring too much. 

The value of only one hoop is revealed to the defending team at the end of a round, (the defending team gets too choose which one) and the defending team then gets to play on the offensive and place the hoops/heights/values how they wish.

This means you won’t always know how far ahead the other team is, only 2 referees and each team will be aware of their score. The first team to get to 26 wins. 1 hour time limit, 15 minute rounds, whoever is closest to 26 wins. Referee ends game as soon as score limit or time is up.",Lokolooks26,1633005166

But what if, like Australia and New Zealand did, Tristan Da Cunha and Pitcairn Island granted long term right of abode to *each other’s* citizens? I bet they’d relate to each other on a lot of life’s daily struggles, in a way people from nearly anywhere else kind of can’t.

A. It saves time, water, and resources (trees)

Q. Why not just delete the feces?
A. Matter cannot be destroyed

Q. Is this even possible

Some of the participants filed lawsuits against the network, and the show was cancelled. But I think there's a way this could succeed, and the concept could be taken way further.

An alternative to this, would be to use prison inmates who are already serving life sentences. The network could make a deal in which the profits from the show would be split 50/50 with the US government/private prison owners. Instead of cash rewards, the prisoners could compete for better cells, access to electronics, nice meals, etc. This would save the network a lot of money, and they wouldn't have to worry about lawsuits, and it wouldn't be considered to be as wrong morally because the prisoners had done bad things in the past - so they could be subjected to more extreme torture. People would want to watch mass murderers, child molesters, drug dealers be tortured, and nobody would care if they died or suffered severe injuries. People would watch out of morbid curiosity, the same as why people go on LiveLeak, bestgore, etc. 

 And it's not like the prisoners would be forced to do it - it would be voluntary, and they would be made to sign a waiver. I think they actually would want to do it as well, because why not? They're already serving a life sentence, after all.",spyder_sul,1632711341

4618,Fines for speeding violations or other small crimes should be proportional to the criminal's net worth.,"Considering the fact that certain crimes such as speeding are victimless (they only have the possibility of creating victims), there are no damages to pay reparations for.

Some crimes that result in a fine are simply unfair for lower-income people, especially when you remember that many small crimes are unintentionally broken without intent to harm. 

If a small crime results in a fine of 10,000 dollars, this would cause heavy financial impact on a poor person because 10,000 dollars is a huge amount of money to poor people, but 10,000 dollars would be like a speck of dust if you're a rich businessmen with millions of dollars.

If fines were dealt according to a person's net worth, the justice system would be much more fair. This way, punishment fines would have equal impact on the person regardless of wealth.

Also remember that rich people could afford better lawyers who are more experienced with legal loopholes and know how to use unethical means of psychological manipulation to drive the jury/judge in their favor. 

Some people say that we should just return to communism and have equally distributed wealth but I don't really agree with communism because most rich people have worked hard for their wealth and put in lots of effort and it'll be simply unfair to take all their wealth away.",Yt_GamingwithCharlie,1632595233

I’m pretty sure cloning, both human and animal, is illegal in most places right now, so this business idea skirts around all that (and saves a lot of $ by avoiding the “big science” of it all).

Why not start a service for collecting/storing pet DNA (or stem cells or whatever it is you need for cloning). There would be an initial fee for collection of the sample (you bring in your living dog/cat), and then there is a yearly fee for storage of the sample. The idea would be that if, years from now, you ever want to ship the sample off to a lab in a country with more lax cloning laws (or if your country legalizes), we’d be happy to do that for you. 

Everyone has had THAT pet, the one you know you were so lucky to have, and that no other pet could ever match. Regardless of the rationality of this actual business concept, I think people would be lining up just for the chance, the hope, that someday they could have that very same (at least genetically) pet again. I don’t know what the fees would be, but I think if you could keep them to like 250$ initial collection, 100$ yearly storage fee (it’s only a vial after all), you could make a billion dollars by next week.",BARRYTHUNDERWOOD,1632523918

Of course the most popular question, if time travel is somehow possible, Greene answered with yes.

According to Greene, there would be exactly two different ways to travel through time. Traveling into the future is one of them and this is also the one that many scientists agree, should actually be feasible. Professor Greene says that Albert Einstein explained mankind how time travel works and it is astonishing to him, that people know next to nothing about it.

4704,"Robert Rodriguez should make a PG-13-rated grand finale sequel to the ""Spy Kids"" films except for the fourth to appeal to the older fans who grew up watching the first three and loved them.","I mean, c'mon, think about it! Who wouldn't want another *Spy Kids* sequel, except with the original cast including Daryl Sabara, Alexa PenaVega, Antonio Banderas, and Carla Gugino returning (albeit as older versions of their characters), and the fact that this time round it's rated PG-13?! And as a nostalgic tribute to the first three films and fans of the original trilogy that also happens to be the?! That would be pretty **dope!**

My own guess would be that it, as said above, would appeal to the *older* fans of the franchise (without it being rated R either) who grew up watching the first three movies (*Spy Kids*, *Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams*, and *Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over*) and saw them as nostalgic, and perhaps would be the ***TRUE*** grand finale in order to make up for *Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World* being the absolute garbage that it was and an unnecessary addition to the franchise. Maybe it could focus on the original family (Juni, Carmen, and their parents Gregorio and Ingrid) getting back together because of an event that *forces* them to reunite as they so happen to be at odds with each other - maybe it's ""Uncle"" Machete getting killed by the film's villain and George Clooney - who so happens to be holding the funeral service - enlisting them to defeat the villain who killed Machete. And he's far eviler than all the other *Spy Kids* villains. And maybe to end off the film, have *all four of the protagonists* sacrifice their own lives in what may be the saddest and most emotional moment in the *Spy Kids* franchise as we say goodbye to the characters we probably grew up watching and loving, all whilst defeating the completely ruthless villain in the process, and their deaths would equally be as sad as John Coffey's execution in *The Green Mile* and the Paul Walker ""See You Again"" tribute at the end of *Furious 7*. Basically, it's still a *Spy Kids* film, with the usual humor and charm (that was absent from the otherwise terrible fourth film), but with elements of the more dramatically intense and PG-13 rated *Fast and Furious*, *James Bond* and Marvel Cinematic Universe franchises, with more adult situations going on and a sudden uptake in crude, slightly adult humor.

My title for the film? Either *Spy Kids: One Last Mission*, *Spy Kids: One Last Mission with the Cortezes* or *Spy Kids: The Last Round*. Or since the ""kids"" in the title are no longer kids, maybe change the *Spy Kids* bit to *Spies*, at least. But what would you call it? (And also, how would audiences know that it's a *Spy Kids* film?)

My guess, for the film's age rating, is that it would be rated PG-13 by the MPAA for ""intense thematic material and action violence throughout and for some language and suggestive crude humor"", just to show how mature it is when compared to the otherwise PG-rated original trilogy (and the fourth film as well). It will also be rated ""12A"" in Britain, and ""M"" in Australia as a result.

Also, they confirmed a ""reboot"" a while back but I'm pretty it was Robert Rodriguez just trolling and maybe wanting to make a fifth and final film in the franchise to make up for the sinful criminal act that was *Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World*. **MAKE** ***SPY KIDS 5*** **ALREADY SO WE CAN CREATE WORLD PEACE!**",Seth-Stacker-69,1632401198

4707,A Bank to support Science instead of Paying Bonuses!,"Here is my crazy idea with a bit of story.

# When I was working as a scientist at Imperial College London, someone told me: “If the banks donated 1% of their profits to scientific research, cancer would be cured today.” 

# This statement stuck with me. 

After I changed my career from science to work in fintech, the statement gave me sleepless nights wondering if there is a solution to increase funding in science.

After much brainstorming, my idea was that I needed to combine the source of money with science. Thus, the concept of Science Bank was born. 

**Science Bank is a bank to support science instead of, simply put, pay bonuses.**

For example, Barclays Bank netted a net profit of 4.3 billion British Pounds in 2019. If 5% of it were invested in scientific research, that would be an investment of 218 million. The contribution would be significantly and increase UK’s research funding up to 25%. Considering that an average research project cost is 300k GBP, Barclays could sponsor 726 per year. One can only imagine what discoveries this would lead to.

Now, like many of you, unfortunately, I lost my mother this year to cancer. Following this event, I couldn’t sit still anymore and wait for banks to change; I decided to build a bank for science.

**Science Bnk was born.** [**www.science-bnk.com**](http://www.science-bnk.com/)

(\*Bnk stands for Bank, the UK financial conduct authority prohibits to call yourself Bank until the banking license is approved. We have just started our application.)

* Our number one mission is to keep your money secure and deliver a flawless and innovative banking service to you. But as explained above, we are here to advance society by investing in science and technology - the ultimate sustainability investment.
* Every year we accumulate an investment pot derived from our revenues and customer contributions. The investments are then distributed by our scientific committee, consisting of 20 academics all of high stature and national academies, to the best grant applications. The cool thing is, in the case of research leading to a great company, you as a customer will own share.

Increasingly suburbs have become more Democrat voting, or at least take on more characteristics of the cities they surround. The most clear example of this are the Atlanta suburbs which Romney won easily in 2012, that went on to be the reason Biden won Georgia in 2020.

But what if ""suburbs"" could flip adjacent states, thanks to high speed rail.

For example, Wyoming has a small population. High speed rail to Cheyenne would essentially make Cheyenne a Denver suburb, and attract a Democrat voting population to live there. They would overwhelm the Republicans given enough time.

Lots of proposed high speed rail corridors to Chicago go through Indiana. The Chicago suburb parts of Indiana were enough for Obama to carry the state in 2008. Imagine if much of the state was, in practice, Chicago suburbs.

4791,Is it an objectively feasible reality for society to go on without a currency system?,"It seems to me (from a layman perspective) that we really only have currency in order to hold accountability for purchases made which is a completely valid concern mind you.   


However, would we not be better off supporting others and proliferating human society based on our support requirements, cost benefit analysis of risk based on geographical values and concerns without using currency? A system where we invest, not in any sort of monetary value but rather in each other and build each other up based on the objective reality rather than having a perceived notion/ dogmatic outdated approach that tangible money or otherwise is the only determining factor in the progression of our society.  


And also, due to the world being (somewhat) out of the age of industrial era, able to communicate at such a large scale and also relatively well off in regards to creature comforts, we would now be within the scope of planning such a system no?   


It would seemingly tackle the issues of democracy authoritarianism and socialism; all of which (for better or worse) has plagued us since we as humans first came to fruition since accountability via arbitrary monetary values would no longer be a problem because of the aforementioned support requirements/ cost benefit analysis of risk/ geographical values and concerns since the onus of progression would be completely transparent and voted on via your locality/ region and thus would be determined by society as a whole.  


This isn't something that would be implemented for a long time since we still live in unfair systems and continue (whether knowingly or not) to confine ourselves to perceived dogma in a fruitless attempt to grasp for control over unexplained/ undiscovered locomotion of the world.

4810,"All right, hear me out: What if the Middle-Eastern countries would get together to donate land outside of 'Israeli territory', and form a new Palestian micro-estate for the Palestinian people?","I mean, why not? The British created the estate of Israel with the help of the US, which legitimized it by recognition. Why couldn’t the same be done for the Palestinian people? Many countries in the Middle-East are sympathetic to Palestine while at the same time depising Israel, so why not get together and form a new Palestinian micro estate, somewhere else?

There are of course many downsides that come with this idea. One of them is the fact that the Palestinians then wouldn’t have any historical connection to the ’new’ land. So a best case scenario for them would of course be one where they both got the peace they wanted, as well as getting to stay in the region. This doesn’t seem to be possible though, since Palestina and Israel just don’t seem to be able to live side by side; and since they’re the minority in the region, this could hypothetically be a good solution.

The hardest part would probably be to get the Middle-Eastern countries to be willing to donate the land, and sacrifice the resources necessary for such a grand scale plan. This could hypothetically work though, if enough motivation could somehow be generated. Even non Middle-Eastern countries could help out with the funding, and would probably ethically be forced to, so as to not come out as unsympathetic to such a politically relevant conflict.",Araknhak,1632139285

When we write in our diary, it's hard to find things that you've written before. This is because of the format/layout. A diary is a timeline, it's a history of thoughts.

It's not helpful if we can't find our msgs or notes. A good way is being able to tag each note or msg that you've written.

Searching is a helpful way, and tagging is a helpful way. But tagging is a much much more helpful way because we don't remember the exact words we used. There's so many words, so tagging is going to be much more helpful in diary writing. What good apps are there for that?   For desktop.

How exactly does the suggested app do searching? And how exactly does the suggested app do tagging? Is it just the regular way of doing tagging?

This is a different interpretation than I've seen on the internet so far so hope you find it fun.," So you may have seen a question like this before. I have myself but the previous askers of this question seem to think that good dreams/nightmare are glimpses into heaven/hell. While they propose the question, is are dreams heaven? I propose a different question. Is heaven a dream? what if heaven is just the dream that occurs when one's body dies but whatever this thing that makes us self-aware and conscious survives and now that it no longer has a vessel to be ""awake"" in so it goes into a ""sleep"" (which is a terminology that's been used for a very long time, research pending on how old but I would guess old enough) and as a result it goes into a even deeper rem sleep and either has a good dream or a nightmare. The next question that is important to the big picture is what decides whether we have good or bad dreams and does it still apply to the ""provectus dream"" (idk name work in progress, basically dream but advanced/enhance (idk which is correct yet)). Well just like many religions it is decided by something out of your control whether it be a god or a universal law but nevertheless something they feel forced to comply to due to their weakness. Now I want everyone reading this to remember that humans used to be really stupid. If an ""absolute idiot to modern standards"" / ""genius of their tribe"" realizes somehow realizes that there is A.) something deciding their fate when they die and B.) their is something either good or bad after life then they very well could go jumping to an incalculable amount of false conclusions based upon their small understanding of what and how the world is. If a tribesperson realizes that A.) is true then I believe one of the few ways he could interpret it is that it must be some entity greater than him, just like how he may view a leader in his tribe, which is the birth of the concept of god. If a tribesperson realizes B.) from making the connection that death is like sleep then he could jump to the conclusion (possibly easily due to humans being out of the box thinkers when they know little) that good dreams and nightmares are heaven and hell, and get this, purgatory is the absence of dreaming (idk that connection was kind of fun to make). So does the way that the judgement occurs in lets say Abrahamic religions, Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, Sikhism (little more complicated with that one however), ancient Egyptian religion, and non-religious morality in certain governments coincide with the thing that ""chooses"" between good and bad dreams in our head. Yes it does. Nightmares are caused by pain and guilt and stress and what one may call ""sins/bad karma"". The same correlation goes for good dreams; when a good dream occurs it is caused by healthy sleep which isn't interrupted by any negative influences. So in the case where the what if is false then this still gives us a possible way that the concepts of afterlife and the judgement where first introduced to early humans. Maybe I'm just crazy but this was fun to write so whatever.",Scoldingtitan36,1632094973

4839,The ideal temperature system is one where 0 degrees is the freezing point of water and 100 degrees is the human body temperature.,"Hear me out--

The most common use cases for a temperature system should be the most simple to represent on that temperature system. Celsius and Fahrenheit both get this right and wrong.

Celsius is right in having ""0 degrees"" as the freezing point of water. That is a temperature that almost every human will experience in their life. A lot of changes in life happen at zero degrees. Snow becomes possible. Water lines freeze up on houses/trailers. You have to worry about ice on the road.

Where Celsius gets it wrong is that ""100 degrees"" should not be the boiling point of water. Sure, every human boils water at some point, but do they care about the numerical temperature for that? Outside of scientific contexts (which should just use Kelvin anyway), how often is ""80 degrees Celsius"" or ""65 degrees Celsius"" an interesting temperature value that someone is likely to mention?

Fahrenheit is right in having ""100 degrees"" be an (almost) reasonable temperature. It's (almost) the temperature of a human body. We know (almost) that higher than 100 degrees is a fever. We know (almost) that higher than 100 degrees (wet bulb temp) a breeze will not cool you off and will make you hotter.

Fahrenheit is wrong in that the ""0 degrees"" temperature makes absolutely no sense. It's a weird drop below freezing temperatures with no useful relativity to it.

I'd argue that the best scale would index itself by having ""0 degrees"" be ""the freezing point of water at standard pressure"", and ""100 degrees"" as ""the average human body temperature"". In this way, it forms a nice 0-100 scale where we use the entire scale in common human experience. We'd immediately know that negative temperatures mean ""freezing"". The middle of the scale would be relatively close to room temperature (57 degrees in this new scale is approximately where ""room temperature"" is. 50 degrees in this new scale is ~65 degrees fahrenheit or ~18.5 degrees C).

PS:
1. Yes, this scale is not useful for scientific purposes. Purely useful for day-to-day purposes.  
2. I know that you can use Celsius to index to Joules, etc. How often are people using Joules in day-to-day parlance, or more importantly, discussing ""joules needed to heat a given volume of water a given number of degrees.  
3. I know that the perceived ""standard human body temperature"" has changed over time. We can try to get as close as possible so that even if we do change it, it's still arbitrarily close to 100.  
4. I know that Kelvin and Celsius are linked by having the same delta value. I'm just arguing to stop using Celsius and instead just use Kelvin in those contexts.",Ronnocerman,1632076452

4848,"All right, hear me out: What if the Middle-Eastern countries would get together to donate land outside of 'Israeli territory', and form a new Palestian micro-estate for the Palestinian people?","I mean, why not? The British created the estate of Israel with the help of the US, which legitimized it by recognition. Why couldn’t the same be done for the Palestinian people? Many countries in the Middle-East are sympathetic to Palestine while at the same time depising Israel, so why not get together and form a new Palestinian micro estate, somewhere else?

There are of course many downsides that come with this idea. One of them is the fact that the Palestinians then wouldn’t have any historical connection to the ’new’ land. So a best case scenario for them would of course be one where they both got the peace they wanted, as well as getting to stay in the region. This doesn’t seem to be possible though, since Palestina and Israel just don’t seem to be able to live side by side; and since they’re the minority in the region, this could hypothetically be a good solution.

The hardest part would probably be to get the Middle-Eastern countries to be willing to donate the land, and sacrifice the resources necessary for such a grand scale plan. This could hypothetically work though, if enough motivation could somehow be generated. Even non Middle-Eastern countries could help out with the funding, and would probably ethically be forced to, so as to not come out as unsympathetic to such a politically relevant conflict.

**PS:** I think that we sometimes forget that the word ’hard’ isn’t a synonym for the word ’impossible’. Crazy ideas are sometimes the ones that actually make a difference. I am not naive to the complexity of a problem like this one, but we literally splitted the atom, so I see no reason why peace in the Middle-East should be an impossible feat to accomplish.

4873,I'm giving her sexual/romantic freedom. She's not (yet). What to do?," Hey guys, I need some advice on how to approach opening up my relationship with my girlfriend. I'm 29 (male) and she's 24 (female).

The text is quite long but winding, spicy and interesting. If you have the inclination to read it and share your perspective/advice, I would very much appreciate it:

**A. The ""issue"" is that the relationship is:**

\- Open on my side, meaning I let her and even encourage her to connect sexually/emotionally with guys that she's into (as long as I'm her primary and we still live together etc.). I have allot of compersion to give and also have a hotwifing kink.

\- Closed on her side, meaning she has a bit of anxious attachment (if you guys know attachment styles) and would get a bit anxious/jealous if I did anything sexual/romantic with anyone (she's okay with me flirting and having close female friends as long as I'm not actively pursuing something romantic/sexual)

**B. I've been okay with this arrangement for most of our 3-year relationship because:**

\- The fact that I get to flirt heavily satisfies my need to chase and what I consider is my polyamorous nature. I also get to connect emotionally, but not sexually.

\- I didn't think that we should be equals in our capacity to offer compersion. I (for various reasons that are too long to get into) can offer compersion easily, and for her it's much more difficult, almost impossible (because of her anxiety/slight jealousy). So I try not to get her hurt through my actions

**C. Her sexual/romantic escapades while being together (with my consent and enthusiastic encouragement):**

\- 2 threesomes with my best friend and me

\- 2 one-night stands, one with a common friend in a bathroom at a party

\- 5-10 fuck sessions with a good friend with benefits of hers

\- 20 love-making sessions (with sleeping over some of them) with an older guy that wanted to have her babies, marry her etc.

\- 80+ very hot, romantic sex sessions with a guy she's in love with (they've also been on 4-5 trips out of town together in the past 6 months, since they've known each other)

**D. I feel we could start exploring her giving me similar freedoms as I give her. I'll give some context on this change:**

\- She's had what we initially thought was a friends with benefits relationship with a guy in the past 6 months, but they fell in love about 1 month in, gave each other gifts, fucked maybe 80+ times (3-4 times a week on average), went on 4-5 trips together.

\- They're not officially together and they don't put any label on their relationship besides friendship with all these sexual/romantic benefits. Although the guy is a bit jealous and would ideally want her to be with him and only with him.

\- I think they're basically together, in a full-blown romantic relationship. She's maybe 60-70% with me and 30-40% with him time-wise.

\- She considers herself mono (although she's clearly not, based on behavior), mainly because of guilt that she feels she might be betraying me, although I'm constantly showing her that I'm not only totally ok with this, but also horny about it (thanks to my hotwifing kink)

\- Also she keeps saying she's mono and she can stop with this guy if I ask her to (because she can't handle me having the same freedoms)

**E. What I want to happen going forward:**

E1) I want them to stop beating around the bush, be adults, own it and start naming their relationship for what it is: a romantic relationship. Admit that they ""are together"" at least for themselves and for me, even if they chose to keep it unofficial towards the rest of the world (I wouldn't mind if she would officially &amp; openly talk about this)

E2) Offer me the freedom to romantically/sexually connect with other girls as long as I'm still giving her attention/love/care/great sex. In the 30-40% of the time when she's hooking up with this guy, I can have my freedom also (and talk to her about it, if that's what she wants).

E3) Freely and openly talk about my crushes with her in the same way that I've given her the freedom and love to talk about hers in the past 3 years

**F. My dilemma is this:**

F1) Even though I want the above things to happen, I ideally want her to offer these things to me (and this hasn't happened until now, despite me opening the discussion many times). It would only happen if I'm very pushy/determined to take my freedom, most likely.

F2) I'm afraid she will agree with ""giving me freedom"" out of desperation that I'm pushy about it, out of guilt about her relationship with this guy and out of of need to be ""fair"" even though she feels anxious/uncomfortable about it

F3) Ultimately, I'm afraid that this will drive a wedge in our relationship and pull us apart. Even though we're super close and want to get married etc. (see below for more details on that)

**G. A bit of context on our connection:**

\- We've been together for 3 years, knew within hours of talking that we would be together

\- Moved in almost immediately, within 2 days

\- Built this beautiful home with all the little gifts and treasures we gathered from our adventures together

\- Want to get married in about 2 years (after she finishes University), get pregnant in 3 and have the baby in 4 years from now

\- We're super sexually attracted to each other, absolutely obsessed. We find each other extremely hot and cute and beautiful and everything.

\- We connect deeply on artistic/cultural topics and understand/feel them in a similar way and this is crucial for us in any romantic relationship",hotwife_couple28,1632008614

4903,Corporate anti-snowflake course,"Big companies are now into providing learning opportunities to there employees. Aside from technical courses that are directly related to the job functions of employees, among the popular courses are those about diversity and inclusion. It supposedly make employees work together despite of differences in gender, race, religion, nationality, etc.

But then, it is also common that there are employees who end whiners and crybabies when put in a situation where they have to interact with people with different politics or beliefs from them. For example:

* [Mozilla employees telling people Brendan Eich to step down back in 2014, when he have yet to demonstrate any skills as CEO, just because of some past political donations](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/mozilla-employees-to-brendan-eich-step-down/)
* [Before James Damore was fired, many of his colleagues reacted in an extreme manner, with one saying "" going forward, I cannot — and I will not — work with James Damore.""](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/8/16106728/google-fired-engineer-anti-diversity-memo). While I personally do not agree with Damore, his firing and the way some of his colleagues reacted is extreme. There's even one who threatened physical harm to Damore, but I cannot find now the source where I read it.
* In AskAmanage, [there's a a story of a museum intern who refuse to accompany a politician just because she does not agree with his  political views.](https://www.askamanager.org/2018/07/my-intern-is-refusing-assignments-because-of-her-politics.html)

So, aside from Diversity and Inclusion courses, I would like to suggest an Anti Snowflake Course. 

At the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Work with different people across political spectrum
* Remain calm and reasonable when faced with expression of different political views
* Embrace that diversity of opinion is a normal part of daily work and living",GretzTheTeacher,1631946459

 we all need to stop conforming to this system that we have created, and we need to work together, as corporations as small businesses, as citizens, and as communities to really change how we live our lives. 
We need to utilize the technology we have we need to utilize the land we have  and we need to quit being so selfish. 
We need to wake up that extra hour earlier so we can bike to work or we need to get a job that is closer. 
We need to stop being so busy and we need to figure out ways to not consume so fucking much of everything now while we still have choice to do so in a still beautiful planet. We need to look at the facts and actually change ourselves. We need to understand what is necessary and we need to work together as citizens to accomplish these things. 
Every one has the ability to work for money but it seems few have the ability to work for free or charge less. 
Why cant we be repaid in having enough resources to sustain our future? 
If it meant our home that allows us to live and thrive and continue to evolve and experience on will be able to continue, could we all just do what is best from this point forward? 
All it would take is losing the selfish luxuries that we have grown to feel entitled or have the right to do. 
Everyone knows they are guilty on some level.
We need to stop being CONSUMERS and PRODUCERS and we need to stop working for a paycheck because it is EXHAUSTING our planet as well as ourselves and we wont get to choose sooner or later. 
Everyday people who dont make a significant amount of money to fly into space and live on mars need to make changes to our lives so we can comfortably stay here.
We have technology and we have the ability we just dont have the selflessness it takes to make a global difference.

And some moments in the book just seem like they'd fit very well in a Disney-esque (wouldn't want this to be done by Disney but I want it to feel like the sort of animated musical they'd do) animated musical and I don't just mean the songs (of which there are a lot in the books but I'd want more than just the dwarves to sing) but things like at Bilbo's ""unexpected party"" the dwarves all pulling out instruments from seeming ""hammerspace"" to accompany their singing or a lot of things about the part of the story set at Beorn's house (from his animal ""servants"" to when (so as to not freak him out with too many guests at once) Gandalf and Bilbo show up first telling the story of their adventure and timed such that every time the number of the party is mentioned but doesn't correspond with the number of guests already there two more dwarves show up (as people would meme this hypothetical movie adaptation ""and the dwarves start comin' and they don't stop comin' and they don't stop comin' and they don't stop comin'"") to invisible Bilbo squeezing through a ""crack in the door"" to get away from the goblins and losing all of his buttons to even that whole bit with everybody in the trees and the goblin and warg attack seeming like the usual sort of ""dark scary part"" of that kind of kids movie

Now here is my idea. those that got fully vaxxed were trying to live, the relief of government subsidy on burial for the people that did the right thing, would probably incentivize many people. Esp the ones with Big Funeral bills in their family. \[I personally don't care for ""Big Funeral"" but a lot of people do. I am ok with that for them.\]

* If you die of COVID after being vaxxed all the way, the government subsidizes your burial up to the median funeral cost in your county.
* If you are partially vaxxed (at this point, your late for the train and possibly a public health nuisance, but I'd incentivize your burial at 1/2 the median cost of a funeral (you tried, but shoulda listened earlier).
* If you are unvaxxed you pay, no subsidy. Of course with a humane exemption for people that have Medical reasons only, like allergic to vaccine, etc. they can get the full subsidy, if they otherwise maintained best practices.

Means tested. If you're a millionaire I don't think the government needs to pay for your funeral at all. I don't know the number, but some number where economic pain to the remaining relatives is apparent. Then they may become vaccinated as they hear the guy living nearby didn't have vaccine and his family had to give him a shitty funeral that still cost $5K.

4947,The best solution to climate change might be less affordable housing.,"Less affordable housing means that people will have to divert their money away from other things in order to afford a roof above their heads. One major expense they would consider would be cars. As cars progressively become more effective at automated driving, cars will become even more efficient in finding pathways and cutting down on time, gas and other small things. Companies likes Uber and Lyft will likely adopt self-driving cars too as an option for users of the app. Considering that self-driving cars would be better and pathfinding and coordinating with other cars, it’s going to become a more preferred option. This means that people will likely instead of buying their own self-driving car they will instead opt for a self-driving car they can’t rent for less than $50. And as unaffordable housing continues as a problem, people will see the idea of buying their own car as wasteful and impractical. This will in tuen lead to a reduction in cars sales, wich in turn Leads to a reduction in pollution as there are less cars in the streets no that multiple people share cars instead of having their own. 

There will still be families and wealthy individuals that will still buy their own cars but gradually it will become more and more unpopular among the lower class to buy a car. 

Than this development here and in other developed countries will lead to a reduction in car pollution and a small curve in the climate crisis. I say small because India and China still exist.",Stranfort,1631854781

If it can remain nonlethal, genuine, and recruit the most billy badass of billy badasses all over the world, I think its a crazy idea that really could work. If a dart can be thrown exactly between the concept of LAARP'ing and the concept of actual Roman Gladiator deathmatches, then I think it would be a big phenomena. Keep it brutal and as realistic as possible and I think it would be kickass to see incredibly skilled people with medieval weaponry combat have a way to fight with the intensity of an actual deathmatch while still being safe to do as a sport for entertainment.

Rather than waiting millions of years for penguins to sort this out themselves through evolution, why don't we just take Antarctic penguins and transplant a TON of them from Antarctica (the South Pole) to the Arctic (the North Pole)?

Why? a.) More penguins closer to people would be wonderful, b.) THE POLAR BEARS ARE STARVING AND THEY MUST BE SATIATED.

First, I am going to need “binders full of women”. She will be impregnated in whatever way is deemed fit for the occasion. After a short 6 weeks she will need to get an abortion. From this point we will need to find several companies to “knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion…”. For example, using Uber or Lyft to go to the clinic, finding the clinic on Google, taking out a bank loan to pay for the procedure (suggestions are welcome, the more ridiculous the better).

Now this is where we make money. We sue the woman as well as all these companies. The woman will be sued for the minimum, “not less than $10,000 for each abortion…”. Everyone else will be taken for all we can. I use the money made in the case to pay for the woman’s expenses, not legal fees because she admits to everything, and we split the rest of the money. The margins could be huge AND we can do it every 2 to 3 months per female or childbearing age.",NotReallySureMyName,1631317631

What if there was a platform that would just switch streaming apps for you at the click of button without paying for a new monthly subscription so the initial Netflix fee will be passed on to Amazon without you doing anything or paying more you won’t have access to Netflix but you now have Amazon prime video to watch your show without paying more and when your ready to switch back to Netflix just press that same button again.

Lets use the USA as an example; first we vote on a State, then we vote on a city, then we vote on a neighborhood and finally we vote in a community in that Neighborhood and now this community of 3,000 houses is the COMMUNITY of EDEN.

The average price in a average community that we will use is about 80K and a NEW car = 20K cash and thus this individual financial freedom package cost a total 100K

So now in this community there are 3,000 Houses × 100K per house freedom package = 300 Million dollars Cash for us to create this Community of Eden. 

Since we know that in America there are 350 Million Americans then lets PRETEND that only  10 Million Americans mostly Religious and Philanthropic Americans join and support this Community of Eden creation that will allow the individual financial empowerment of 3,000 houses or basically 3,000 families.

So when 10 Million Americans all donate 30 dollars each the math looks like this.     10 Million Americans × 30 Bucks each = 300 Million ÷ 100K house+car = 3,000 Houses recieve this paid house and paid car and thus the COMMUNITY of EDEN.",BigPapiPR83,1631265031

5198,A fairly competitive multiplayer/online game where hacking is a legitimate strategy (within reason),"^(Because things like Temple Run are a useless waste of time with a skill ceiling and pros who will play for so long in one run that the people don't get a lot of money from displayed ads between games, just to get some coins for limited buffs and puny rewards like new character and hat models. It's essentially a useless, repetitive attention-based clicker game that stops developing early on.)

^(And also, speedrunning has it's limits.)

Hacking would be a much better (or just a crazy) idea since people would want to learn to hack to beat the game and do better than other players efficiently.

Some rules:

* Hacking may be restricted to a particular area of the game; i.e. there will be parts of the game you aren't allowed to hack.
* Don't reuse pre-existing software or purchase extravagant software like those ones that scan people's screens rather than check any hidden variables to cheese first-person shooter games. If you make your own software for it, this might be a legitimate high-dedication/reward strategy that gives out more rewards than changing internal variables.
* You can probably only use software you've made or strategies you've come up with for a limited amount of time so you can't just use it all the time.
* If strategies become too popular, methodical or derivative, people might need to show that they came up with the software/strategy on their own and probably start each new strategy from the ground-up.

It can have either a point-based system or just a system where...uh...yeah I think it'll just turn out to have a point-based system. You might also have different levels of players and hackers grouped with each other (for multiplayer games). If normal (good) players go up against high-level hackers, they'll probably get bigger rewards if they do well. I think people would definitely have to manually judge and moderate players and hacks since all AI can and probably would be exploited.

Anyway, it just sounded like a more productive thing to do than consistently play really well for hours on end to the point of just completely making the amount of time predictable while wasting their day and exhausting them.",FireyDeath4,1631218331
5199,Reddit lets make what we want!,"I have an idea that can be perfectly implemented here on Reddit. As a community we could help one another to make the things that we want- movies, video games, comic books and more. 

For example we could all pitch in to formulate a movie from the bottom to the top. Like for example if I were to ask you what is a good plot/storyline for an X-Men movie? I'm sure there are hundreds- thosands of people here who have great ideas when it comes to a plot for a movie, so everyone could simple submit their ideas and thereafter we use the plot/storyline that has the most votes i.e. upvotes or whatever you call em here on Reddit.  After that we could move on to something else like the cast- which actors would play our favorite X-Men, and then once again after the suggestions roll in we use the one that has the most votes.. We could keep doing this process for scenery, dialogue, cinematography, score/music, everything and it all comes down to US! It all comes down to the Reddit community contributed, and voting. 

its that simple. we could even decide how the movie is made. i bet theres enough people and resources on Reddit where we could make the movie on our own.. theres writers, graphic designers, choreographers, cinematographers, directors and actors right here on Reddit.

5207,Ban political parties completely,"Candidates don't have to be experienced, passionate, relevant, or intelligent. If a Republican runs in a Republican area, barring mass damaging scandal, they will win.

Parties also act as vessels for lobbying, allowing one firm to influence many politicians through influencing their party.

They also encourage tribalism, they reduce the scope of ideas available to the electorate, and in turn, they stifle political discussion.

If we didn't have parties, and every politician had to run as an independent, I think these issues start to go away.

Candidates will be forced to make themselves, personally, known to the electorate. They will have to convince them, through actual discourse, rather than elections being an elaborate box-ticking exercise. 

Potential issues I can think of is that there's no real way to police this, that is, if the ex-republicans decided to all meet to discuss what they all should collectively do, this is a party in all but name.

Lobbying would also still be a factor, though I'd be in favour of restricting this too, and this combines with the issue above.

Finally, I can see how this would decrease political engagement overall. Much as tribalism harms democracy, it increases voter turnout. People with no interest in politics, but who might otherwise vote for the party they always vote for, aren't going to take the time to research all the candidates offered to them. However, I think, long-term, the positive effects of this change could mitigate this.

Hey all,

For   a while now, I've been thinking of using my previous community forum   administration experience to create one of my own. Specifically for the   UK, it would be a publicly accessible (would show up on search  engines),  but closed registrations (either requiring approval or invite  only)  forum where people can share their thoughts and opinions on  things like  products and services, or what it's like to work for a  company,  anonymously. By anonymous, the user could choose to be shown  as  anonymous, where only the admins can see who made the post.

Unlike   open platforms like Google reviews, TrustPilot, or Reddit, I will be   specifically focusing on high quality posts, and only people that would   post things that are well written (nuttin lik dis bruvva, na m8),   detailed, and factually correct (providing proof where necessary), would   be allowed to post there. I already know in my head how this would   look, function, and what software I would use... I just need a name!

5214,"As a male, I think that women that drink and party a lot are really unattractive.","I am not sure, but it could be because of my age. I think that as you grow older and start preferring a relationship instead of casual sexual encounters, you automatically look for more motherly traits in women, while looking down on traits that contradict those motherly traits. So drinking and partying comes off as really disgusting to me, when I am looking for someone for a potential relationship.

I feel like this opinion could be misinterpreted as a misogynistic view of women, but my opinion isn’t at all about controlling what women do or not. I feel that life is meant to be a journey of trial and error, no matter what gender you are. But at the same time, women are potential child bearers and statistically almost guaranteed to give birth to at least one child. This is not to say that people can't change though, or that those women that drink and party today will also do it tomorrow when they're pregnant. But those women probably will become pregnant one day, and not everyone does change, so I can't help but feel that the habit of partying and drinking is unattractive on women.",Araknhak,1631194932

My name is Albert, and I’m a 22-year-old tech-lover creating fun and educational electronic devices 😄

I wanted to share my latest project with the rest of the group - it’s named CircuitMess Batmobile™️ 🦇🚗

CircuitMess is a small business that I’m trying to build based on the idea of bringing excitement and joy via fun electronic kits to people all around the world. 🌎

CircuitMess Batmobile™️ is an AI-powered DIY Batmobile kit made in cooperation with Warner Bros.

It’s running on an ESP32 with a 32-bit Nuvoton coprocessor MCU, and an ESP8266 is powering the remote controller.

I’ve been negotiating with WB and working on this product for the past year and a half. Being a huge Batman fan myself, getting to work with the people behind Batman as a brand was a dream come true! ✨

I’ve designed this kit to teach everyone about cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning, computer vision, AI, IoT, and much more, while feeling like the Caped Crusader. 🦇

Everything I do is also open source, Arduino compatible, and hackable. 💻

I would appreciate your honest feedback on the product! 😄

5269,Social media website organized in a tree. Hierarchical branch-pruning ban system.,"New accounts are invite-only, but invites are free and unlimited. Any user at a higher rank in your branch of the invite tree can ban you indiscriminately. When a user is banned, all users in branches below them are banned, too. Reports can come from parallel branches, and work up the chain on an appeal system, with site owner acting like supreme court.

**Benefits**

* Distributed moderation reduces whack-a-moling and moderator burnout. Troll/spam account creation can be quickly cut off at the source. If a user does nothing ban-worthy, but all the accounts they invite do (or many accounts distributed fifteen layers down), then it's easy to see where the problem is rooted and fix it.
* Intra-branch responsibility: Discussing and exemplifying good behaviour both upwards to parents and downwards to children, carefully vetting invitees, and other soft moderation techniques have a chance to flourish.

**Drawbacks**

* Dissent is easily silenced, so echo chambers form more easily. High-level users have an outsized impact on conversation and content makeup. On the other hand, if high-level users actively prune branches which silence dissent, this could be a benefit. [Best-case scenario is if site owner is a philosopher king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_king).
* Compromised high-level accounts can ban large chunks of the site. Possible workaround would be to let higher-ranked users reverse bans in their branch. Ctrl-Z.
* Not trivial to start participating, because you have to know someone, which punishes recluses and lurkers. Optimistically, that would encourage real-world connections and social skills.
* Valuable branches can be lost in collateral damage from otherwise-good bans. Possible workaround would be to allow branch adoption. This seems like it could have abuse potential, but I think it works out as long as every user is always part of some branch.
* Anonymity seems to suffer a bit.

[Small example tree](https://i.imgur.com/5jE52Hx.png). 

* User 1-1-1 can be banned by User 1-1, Admin 1, or Site owner, but not by Admin 2 or User 1-2. 
* User 1-1 can be banned by Admin 1 or Site owner, but not by Admin 2.

**Step 1: Papua New Guinea holds 315 independence referendums, splitting into 316 countries.** 

The next member of the UN may be [Bougainville](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-14/bougainville-is-sitting-on-an-actual-gold-mine/11790498), an island in Papua New Guinea that voted for independence in 2019 but has delayed making moves because of the pandemic. PNG is a hugely diverse country with [839 ](https://www.ethnologue.com/product/20-Digest-PG)spoken languages. So it is not hard to imagine many ethno-linguistic groups seeking independence.

**Step 2: Newly independent countries join a regional political union, called the Union of Former Papua New Guinean States.** 

These new states can continue to use the same currency, have a mutual defense treaty, and share foreign policy goals like other political unions. 

They wouldn't even have to be politically independent of the UFPNGS since UN member Andorra has as its joint heads of state, [the President of France and a local Catholic Bishop.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-Princes_of_Andorra) 

Former Papuan states could just act as local municipal governments that make their own passports.

**Step 3: These new countries join the UN**

This is where it gets tricky. First all New member states have to pass the scrutiny of the P-5. I think that could happen as long as these countries express little interest in UN business until all 316 of them are admitted. As long as all independence referendums are peaceful I don’t see the P-5 paying much attention.  

**Step 4: Former Papua New Guinean States join different regional blocs: Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Western Europe.**

OK, so I may have lost you here since you may not be familiar with the regional groups. Basically, there are 10 non-permanent seats on the security council, and [different regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Regional_Groups#Overview) elect member states to hold these seats for a short term. Africa elects 3, Asia-Pacific 2, Eastern Europe 1, Latin America 2, Western Europe and Others 2. 

The diplomats of the UFPNG States would have to join regional groupings. PNG is in the Asia Pacific group, but since only 2 non-permanent seats are reserved for Asia Pacific, Some former PNG states will have to join other regional groups in order to be elected to 7 of the seats on the security council. 

Non-permanent security council members are elected by having ⅔ support from their regional group. That means, to dominate these votes, Former PNG states have to make up ⅔ of the states in the regional groups. 

I calculate they would need to form 108 new African states, 106 new Asian states (I guess 105 + the original PNG), 56 new Western Europe and Other states, and 46 new Eastern European states. That means PNG would have to break up into a grand total of 316 countries. 

Now how can they join different regions? Papua New Guinea is in the Asia Pacific region, yes. But there is precedent for states joining other groups. Israel and Turkey, as well as Australia and New Zealand are in the [Western Europe and Other group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Regional_Groups#Western_European_and_Others_Group_(WEOG)). It would not be a stretch for some Papuan states to join this region. But Africa? The Austronesian language family would link some Papuan states with Madagascar, but that is a tenuous connection. Eastern Europe? These states are all former socialist countries, so Papuan states could also try out socialism for a day and qualify for this group. 

The good news is, it is up to each country to self identify. For example, Kiribati is not in any regional group, not because it is excluded, but because until recently it did not send a permanent rep to the UN. So as far as I can tell, there are no formal rules that define these regional groupings and each member state self-identifies. 

**Step 5: Former Papua New Guinean states monopolize the votes for temporary Security Council seats. The Union of Former Papua New Guinean States, as a political union, controls 7 seats.**

This is important because it takes 9 votes for the Security Council to pass a resolution according to [Article 27](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-5) of the UN Charter. 

**Step 6: Papua New Guinea can now veto any resolution it wishes, putting it on par with the  P-5. Let your imagination run wild on how Former PNG could use this leverage.** 

**Questions I have:**

Are regional groupings truly up to the whim of the member state? When a new member state is admitted to the UN, how are they assigned to a regional grouping?

Have the non-permanent members of the security council ever failed a resolution that all the permanent 5 supported? To my knowledge, no.

**Foreseeable problems:** 

The P-5 could easily buy off votes of small former Papuan states just as US does with Nauru and Palau. 

**NB4** you say “these countries would be too small” here are some numbers: 

Population of PNG: 8.776 million ÷ 316 = 27,772

Compare to the list of countries by [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population).

Land Area of PNG: 462,840 km\^2 ÷ 316 = 1,464.68 km\^2

Compare to the list of countries by [land area.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area#Countries_and_dependencies_by_area)

1. It can either play it completely straight and have it secretly be a BTTF 4 movie and he really is Doc Brown stuck in an alternate reality and a fictionalized version of Michael J Fox helps him get back to his own reality.

2. It can go more drama where fictionalized versions of the actors play along with the fantasy because fictionalized Christopher Lloyd is suffering from dementia or some form of mental deterioration due to old age.

3. Or the movie could go both directions leaving it ambiguous and left to the audience's imagination if what's happening in the movie is actually happening.",tempest_wing,1630893572

Combination vaccines exist already for other diseases. Speculation about covid+flu+other combination vaccines and updated covid vaccines should be on.

I managed to get piece of information indicating that mixing covid-vaccine in the same syringe with other vaccine would be against the rules, because it is not officially tested for safety and efficacy, at least for now.

5384,I want to start a travel app,"Hi there.

I am Dutch, so bare with me when it comes to my English writing lol.

Due to the pandemic, everyone can not wait to travel again and I want to make everyone's travel experience way better after so long.

I would like to start a travel app based on finding travel buddies with a twist. I have already made a business plan. Now I am looking for a partner to help me brainstorm how we can make this happen and motivate me.

Personally I have been traveling solo for 5 years. So I know how it feels like to be in the middle of nowhere somewhere and you are looking for a local person to have dinner with or guide you around town. Or a way to find other travelers. Some places are easier than others.

There has been times where I met other solo travelers who would use Tinder for connections. And Tinder can be a dangerous app to find casual travel friends. 

I want to make this app easy and safe. Wherever you are on the map, you will see who is around you and logged in as well.

I have already made designs and such. So it would be great to have a partner who can bring something to the table as well and motivate me so we can make this app happen.

These things are just too crunchy and quite frankly they really screwed me over recently. Just a few months back my sister pretty well much decided to get married so she invited me and I was at the reception and she was getting married and well I was just smacking on potato chips. My lips were just smacking and slopping and the damn chips were crunching so dang loud that I couldn’t pretty well much hear what they were saying up at the stand. Damn I was so pissed this was just fucked. After the wedding I went up to my sister and asked what the fuck it was for to get chips this damn crunchy and because of her dumbass decision I couldn’t fucking hear any of the wedding. 

I’d say the best things for chips to do- make them soft as damn silk. I want to be biting into damn napkins not crunchy flat rocks like potato crisp chips pretty well much are today. That way I wouldn’t gotten to hear my sister’s vows and I would’ve  gotten to laugh at the wedding jokes like everyone else.

Once that mission is successful, people can crowdfund a project to raise enough money to DDoS their court system by using that law against them until the stupid law they passed is rendered fucking useless. Then turn against social media websites and other similar ones with the same methods so that no representative that was in support of that law can ever have a successful campaign and be re-elected.

5408,Nonce Reponse - A show where death row inmates hunt pedos for sport and reduced prison sentences,"Me and some friends thought of this and every single detail in less than 12 hours so fyi this is probably the stupidest thing you'll read today.
Basically we're gonna get a team of about 4-5 inmates, strap them with gopros and give them a decent selection in weapons and point them to a target pedo house as we drop them off in the neighborhood via van. We're gonna have drones recording the whole thing from above and have something like a soccer type commentary meanwhile. We've been thinking of getting some guests on the show like maybe Chris Hansen and other celebrities hopefully to co-host commentate. We haven't fully decided if we're gonna let the convicts use lethal force or just rubber bullets so I guess you guys will give your vote. At the end of every episode we're gonna rank the inmates on a point based system for example, who was the most team player, who was the most accurate shot, who found the pedo etc, if we take the non lethal approach to the show then we'd deduct points for brutality and such. We're also gonna have a ranking system that has top 10 of inmates who have caught the most pedos. At the end of every season of the show we'll have something of a boss fight like an old man living in the woods with 68 petabytes of child porn so the prisoners would have to go in with night vision gear and be under a strict stealth only rule.
Now we're gonna have the first season in Florida and the second one in California. We're gonna have a Christmas special battle royal episode on Epstein's island where we invite about 20 unsuspecting pedos on the island under the bait that they've won a holiday then at sunrise we'll airdrop 100ish inmates to hunt them down. 
If the show REALLY takes off we're gonna launch Nonce Reponse: International where the show goes around the world in different countries hunting more pedos. For a final season we're gonna have it set in Vatican city and get a shitton of clues pointing towards the Pope but just as we're about to bust him the show gets cancelled by higher ups (cancelled shows leave more of an impact and are remembered longer).",Shaderini,1630717262

5541,"On how to travel to the 4th spatial dimension, an analogy","Here we discuss how it may be possible to travel outside the 3 dimensional space that we know of. This is an analogy from the 2 dimensional plane of flat land.

Let us take for granted that flatland exists and is inhabited by living creatures in a universe where the physics and math are real and workout. To us this make look like a drawing or picture, but as rules within the 2D space dictate and over time things change.

Now let's examine a flatlander, or flatlandian, would do to get to the third dimension. Let's pretend that they are living in a piece of paper, and that I've trained a webcam to watch them and to watch the sheet straight on so that I might see any 3d modulations. How do you get a piece of paper to pop into the 3rd dimension? from our point of view we can fold it and shape it, bu tto the flatlander there is no external force within the plane that can bend, wrench, fold, or even gain purchase against the plane itself as all forces within it are 2 dimensional. This leaves 2 (or 1) options and that is to somehow generate a force so powerful that it has 3d properties and to use that force. Let's say triangle and square fire two guns at each other so hard/fast/long/big/small whatever that the resulting explosion can somehow rip the paper itself. 
if the paper torn would that not be akin to a black hole? They can put whatever they want into it and it doesn't come back, they ahve to use triagulation to determine the edged, it seems to be a well anaology . It may even be that by adding so many dots to a single point the points themselves begin to exhibit a gravity which pulls them thus causing the tear or maybe rather the strech so that there is an illusion of 3d within a inverted bubbledof 2d spacetime. By using these forces in a targeted manner the flatlander could 'cut' his paper and if he cut a long string of paper, or was able to direct the energy from this into the area that was cut out it might import an orthoganal force that could allow the being to transend the 2Dspace into the 3D, though the creature would remain as a 2D being in a 3D world.
Might it be possible to create a sphere of tiny blackholes, and then nestle that in a mostly but not fully enclosed device that also makes blackholes along it's edge, we could hope to fall out of 3D space and into 4D space and havinging the 'tunnel' of 3D space would allow us to return the way the 2d being can cut a circle around themselves and by using the machine to cut a thin strip of their reality they create a string that the being can use to climb back to flatland with.

5560,An app that will automatically send text messages of your choosing because you’re too busy or forgetful,"I had this crazy idea, and did something about it. Since I felt the idea was a little too crazy, and some might consider it unethical, by default I configured the app to, actually, not do anything automatically without approval first.

Like others, perhaps, I tend to get deeply focused on a task and then I try not to stop until the task is complete. This “hyper-focus” allows me to produce very high-quality work in the shortest amount of time and allows me to be very productive when I’m able to do this.

The problem, for me, is this intense focus tends to keep me in a bubble of sorts and I tend not to reach out to those that are important to me often enough as a result. On top of this, well, I’m probably not the best communicator and the combination of these things has a negative effect on my relationships.

So, I decided to undertake the crazy idea of writing an app to remind me to send little text messages and call those that are important to me regularly.  If you are interested in my story of how this came about, and can suffer some technical detail, it’s [here](https://medium.com/@mtc.dev/my-first-android-app-story-331c98270ec4?source=friends_link&amp;sk=d01250707057ed71f2c7af8ed4ac9eea) as it covers a fair amount.

5590,So I returned 10-year-old Audio Technicas to Amazon...,"PSA: In this post I describe how I took advantage of a lax return policy Amazon has had perhaps since its inception. I acknowledge I'm in the wrong and you can easily feel more secure about your own life choices by pointing it out to me and acknowledging how woke you are for not being such a complete piece of shit. I get it. I apologize in advance for revealing this about myself and the concept of rules get broken. However, this post is not here for your morality lessons and social justices - its intention is instead to point out how massively flawed the quality control of returns is at Amazon. TLDR at bottom.

Once upon a time, Winter 2021. Covid lockdown. I moved to Colorado on a whim. Met some friends, they introduced me to some winter sports, and my hometown buddy and I realized we wanted to try and sled. We've never sled before. And we'll prolly never sled again. Knowing this we bought some sleds off Amazon, used them that weekend, returned them after the sledding trip under the generic reason ""Inaccurate Website Description"" and... Poof, got a refund. And yes, we fully intended to return them from the moment of purchase.

My friend and I essentially coined this concept, ""free rentals"" from Amazon.

We've done it with air mattresses for one-off camping trips, backpacks with specific dimensions for specific strict airlines, etc. Anything we've essentially planned to only use once. We don't return them in bad condition or broken or anything. They're just not, brand new.

Then we got to thinking, what if we had items in our home that we wanted to replace? Could we find them or versions like them on Amazon, buy it off Amazon, unpackage the new purchase, and... repackage the used one from our house claiming Amazon sent a used product, would Amazon take it back?

Quick, related aside: 2011, I was in college and saved up to study for a semester abroad. My first time to Europe. First time anywhere out the US. To accompany the trip, I decided to get a real sweet pair of headphones. Working at Radioshack at the time, an employee recommends the Audio Technica M50s.

I figured he knew what he was talking about, but he insisted I know first-hand. He let me try on his set and I listened to a song I've heard 100 times before, ""Blood on the Ground"" by Incubus. Man! I have NEVER heard the song like this. All the layers. All the background instrumentals. I instantly bought a pair! My trip to France was lovely.

So fastforward to present day, these same AT M50s were still my go-to headset for my at-home gaming. They still work so well. But! They're faded. Peeling. Ripped off label. Aesthetically, they were dead. Decided I'd try my used-return theory on this particular headset. Made the purchase on Amazon. Unpacked the flawless, untouched beauties. Put my old headset inside. Slapped the plastic packaging back around it. Applied for a return slip. Printed it out. Rode over to the drop off point. Returned the used headphones. Kept the crisp brand spanking new ones in my posession.

Then waited. At first, 5 days went by and I thought maybe it was not gonna be approved. Pffft. 6th day, full refund approved. Today? Deposited back into my account.

The size of this company's reach makes obvious screw ups fully acceptable. The Amazon system is so big now that it's quite possible not even a human looked at my return. Perhaps there's many returns to process, that there's no time to give it an organic thought, everything is just a dropdown menu, scripted response that they chalk up to, ""Well I can't be bothered reaching out to the customer or investigating this further... Approved!""

It might not even stop here. What if we buy expensive headphones, buy some very cheap WISH headphones that look nearly identical, then return the WISH headphones to Amazon? Is anyone working at Amazon even gonna be technically ept enough to discern the difference, prolly not. What's to stop people from doing this with multiple household goods that are old, dated, cheap, need replacing?

This was for a $150 headset. What about items that cost less? Cost more?

TLDR: I returned some headphones I bought in 2011 under the guise of replica pair (brand new) that I bought from Amazon in the week prior. Got a full refund. Kept the brand new headphones. This shit is flawed.",Anytimelol,1630364416

So most places of employment have some kind of employee perks / Benefits system such as cycle to work scheme, discount at certain restaurants, gyms, hotels etc and I was wondering if you think (or have ever heard) of companies including direct positive acts of kindness to their employees?

I  have posted out over 150 cards of positivity this year to anyone who has wanted one and has gone down a treat I've had so many people request one and such lovely feedback.

I was thinking of maybe reaching out to businesses to see if they would be open for discussions to pay me to send their employees (ones who would like one as I don't like to send unsolicited cards) some positivity in the post.

I think it seems a bit of a large wish but I guess if they pay companies for other employee benefits, maybe its not too much of an obscure request.

Obviously there would be the GDPR rules etc which I'd be happy to send the cards to the company head office! Pre stamped) to post to their employees addresses and I wouldn't need any information other than a name to address the card to but these options and all work roundable and can be discussed with the company. 

It's Just a thought rolling around my head at the moment.

If your company had something this personal and direct in your employee benefits would that interest you?

Any thoughts and opinions welcome :-)

5649,Could we put electric motor wheels on campers to make them towable by most any vehicle?,"I love camping. I would camp more if I had a camper, but campers are expensive and made even mores by the fact that you have to own a vehicle capable of pulling one. Which is fine, but those vehicles also tend to get much less gas mileage and it feels very wasteful to get garbage gas mileage on your daily driver 90% of the time just so you can go camping 10% of the time. And I cannot really justify having another vehicle only for towing a camper and maybe taking yard waste to the dump 5 times per year.

I've noticed that many electric bicycles and cars have motors that are actually in the hubs of the wheels. This got me wondering, could we put electric motors in the wheels of campers so that they could effectively handle the driving of their own weight and then really be towed/steered by any vehicle we could put a tow hitch on? Of course, it would add expense to the price of the camper, but the motors wouldn't have to be strong—just enough to handle the weight of the camper—and therefore could be less expensive than the motors on electric vehicles. And I would think campers could be designed and built that would allow for it to be an add-on option, so that there wouldn't have to be a lot of added expense in engineering many different designs.

Democracy itself is good as it gives the people power. However, it does has it flaws. Firstly, too many voices would mean that nothing can be decided. We have all seen this many times before, even in historical contact, i.e. the weimar government.

On top of that, in most democratic countries, for one to achieve the highest rank in the government, it has to take many years for most people. We have so many presidents around the world who took office after 50. They then lead for around 10-20 years before retiring. Sometimes they dont even have 10 years to lead as they are voted out/ retired within a term.

Now for monarchy/dictatorship. It is unfair to most people having one family rule the entire country. If odds are in their favour they might get a benevolent king/dictator, but sometimes they get a bad one. The good thing about this is that from young, the crown prince/princess will get to have experience in leading and guidance from the king and queen themselves, or the dictator could make a decision that would not be overridden.

Now, demonarchy/demotatorship (what I call it). You give the people the ability to vote for their parliament/cabinet/congress as usual. Just that you also give them the rights to vote for a monarch/dictator. This monarch will continue being a monarch/dictator continue being a dictator. Until one day, the new monarch or the dictator has proven incapable of leading/evil/not acting in the good of people. Then the people get a chance to gather and vote the monarch/dictator out. The twist is that, just like you need a majority vote to win, u need a majority vote to get kicked out of power. This way, if people manage to vote for a leader who is capable and cares about the people, they can continue leading for years without any challenge and they can gain experience as time goes by so does their children and successor. The crown prince will be born to lead, and be taught how to lead from young instead of useless stuff like math and science.

Of course measures must be taken to ensure the leader cannot seize absolute power.",Any_Sundae_7501,1630175752

5697,We shouldn’t teach children the names of animals that only live in zoos.,"Open any children’s book about animals, and you’ll always see the same ones: lion, tiger, rhino, elephant, giraffe, shark, etc. Although it’s not bad to teach about endangered species, I think the focus should be on common animals in the region you live in. Ask any child to look outside and call any animal it sees by its name – it’ll likely not be more precise than “bird” or “insect”.

Sure, zoo animals may be more fascinating in their behaviour and looks, and (animated) films often have these animals as their main characters so it’s not bad to be able to identify them. But I think this is all _just because_ they’re the only animals that children know.

The only place you’ll see zoo animals in real life … is in the zoo. So why would you not teach children the names of animals they see daily? They’ll be able to put their knowledge to good use and learn to recognise animals everywhere they go. I think the gains outweigh the losses here.",casperdewith,1630153763

Endless choices gives you paralysis analysis. You are more likely to skim through low quality matches rather than focus on building something great with one special person.

Once a month it connects you with one person for whom you are both a 90% match or higher. If there is no one who is a mutual 90%, you get no match, but you have the option to change or reduce your criteria and try again. I guess the point is you have to decide which criteria are really important to you and which ones you are open to.

The app then helps you out with conversation prompts, get-to-know-each-other games, date ideas etc. At the end of the month, you can decide to take your relationship to the next level or simply leave it there.

So I propose a chain of drug stores that actually offer pricing reflecting their operating costs. Or, even better, an automated store with virtual pharmacists available for consultations. Hospitals have machines dispensing meds, we have car vending machines, we have automated banking, why not have automated drug stores? Even if they didn't have  controlled (narcotics, etc) it would be valid.

5931,A dating app that uses a market-based approach to balance the number of men and women using the service,"The problem:  Most dating apps have many more men than women who active users, creating an imbalance which makes it harder for men to find matches.

The solution: A market-based approach to balance the gender of users to 50/50 by charging men a monthly fee that increases based on the ratio of men to women on the service.  As it gets more expensive more men will discontinue the service leading to the ratio falling back towards 50/50.  

Example:  Tod signs up for MarketDate at a base rate of $10/month.  When he signs up the balance of men to women is 50/50.  Over a period of time more men than women sign up for the service leading to the ratio becoming 60/40 men/women.  Tod's monthly cost increases to $15/month, $20/month, $30/month, etc, as it does for other men using the service until enough of them discontinue use to bring the balance back.  If the ratio switches the other direction such that there are more women than men using the service the monthly cost for men would fall to encourage more to sign up.",tutetibiimperes,1629654567

5935,Why are lottery machines allowed to report the numbers chosen?,"If lottery machines are allowed to report what numbers you picked for your ticket before the daily draw. That could let them know what numbers to exclude to avoid giving massive payouts. Since the lottery draw numbers are computer generated now in some states. 

Its like asking someone to guess how many fingers you're sticking out behind your back, but then telling them exactly how many fingers you're sticking out before they guess. 

Instead if they want to confirm that your ticket matches, they should report a hash of your numbers plus a 128 bit salt that is printed on the back of your ticket.

That way they don't get access to the numbers you picked, but can still verify that you did pick those numbers since trying to brute force a hash match would be too timely, costly, and technically difficult.

5937,Portable mall on rail cars to supply and encourage people to live in small towns,"Tons of historic towns are losing population to packed cities that are cramming in overpriced junk housing. Yet, said towns are served only by Dollar General and Walmart (gross). Lots of remote workers could benefit from less expensive housing in small towns, but are going to want big-city amenities. Not every town is ready to open finer restaurants, coffee shops, cleaners, theatre, etc. Solution: state sponsored strings of rail cars that are moved among small towns daily to bring in nicer retail/dining, wine and deli, building materials, furniture/home goods, museum exhibits, live music, and health/human services. Make use of existing sidings and freight rail infrastructure. It doesn't have to be perfect or large-scale to start with, and it's completely scalable, so can be started with as few as half a dozen cars on a trial basis. States can obtain surplus rail cars economically and outfit them for retail, office, and personnel accommodation space. Lease the cars to retail establishments. Re-supply in big cities on the route. Haul away the junk and debris that small towns have a hard time getting rid of, and recyclables. Deliver and pick up large construction equipment to facilitate repairing and rebuilding in the town. State makes a little on the scrap steel and consumer recyclables. Residents sign up on one state site and submit feedback for goods/services desired and frequency, as well as make appointments for doctor, mental health, business consultants, computer geek etc. that travel with the trains. Car strings have accommodations for personnel and can be solar-powered in-station. Little by little, the small towns can develop their depots and decide what permanent businesses to rebuild based on new demographics. This is more of a relocation incentive than simply counting on mail-ordering everything if you try to move to a small town. You would be able to shop for wine and fresh produce, coffee, upscale clothing etc. a couple of times a week on the rail mall, see rotating arts and culture, and have fine dining experiences. Get a blood test and screenings without having to drive across the county. Bring a business consultant out to an existing, old business and get advice on updating it. Etc. People need human interaction and morale. Yes, the state will have to make an investment, but it's less expensive than brick-and-mortar initiatives since it's an evolving situation, and far less expensive than building new roads and utilities for new construction.

5947,Create a global currency based on clean energy,"With Russia moving to further develop Arctic oil, despite a UN red alert on climate change, an economic war is very possible, and one that threatens the fight against climate change. Basically, if Russia (or anyone else) just keeps extracting and using cheap fossil fuels, they have a huge economic advantage over other nations who are trying to do the right (and expensive) thing in switching to low carbon energy sources.

The crazy idea solution is to create an economic incentive to only use clean energy, on a nation to nation basis. Create a global currency that is tethered to clean energy generation. Currently there are systems of carbon credits out there, that function as currency for large corporations to buy regulatory forgiveness (I buy carbon credits with cash so I can pollute more than I would otherwise be allowed kinda thing). 


What if carbon credits could buy a loaf of bread? What if they could buy a tv? What if I couldn’t buy a new car without carbon credits? What if I had to pay entirely with carbon credits? What if I could shop around for the cheapest carbon credits? The solar farm in China is selling them for $100 per ton. The tidal project in Scotland is selling them for $40 per ton, but they sell out fast. I can get my car cheaper if I buy cheaper carbon credits. The credit creators make more profit by creating more credits for cheaper.

Some generators will choose to go the carbon capture route. Some will go the energy generation route. The number of credits issued to energy generation will need to be relative to some benchmark, like global average co2 emissions from generating a KWh from coal in 2020 or something like that.

Generators will also need to pay carbon credits for their raw materials. Steel will have a carbon cost. Concrete too.

5957,Official Robolympics,"I thought I had heard this before so I did some research and there wasnt anything relavent so this idea is original!

Every four years, alongside the Olympics and Paralympics we should have the Robolympics, in which engineers create robots to compete against other robots in Olympic events.

Instead of training for years like Olympians, the contestants will spend that time designing, building and coding and testing their bots.

There should be category's such as Humanoid (walks on two legs without wheels) and Non-Humanoid (Probably looks like one of those vacuuming things)

It would be very interesting to, if this ever happens, compare the very first ones to the ones to come in 30 years time and see how much difference there is with robotics improving more and more e.g. the time difference between the robot that wins the 100m sprint on the first one and the robot that wins the 100m sprint 30 years later.

So, if they work for $15/hr USD, 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year:

Have all applicants who meet the minimum requirements complete a thorough and detailed questionnaire about their positions on every issue and how much of a priority it is to them, their strategies for handling every issue, their beliefs, experience, demographics, and background. Even a personality test. 

Then every voter answer a similarly thorough survey about their own positions and beliefs about how specific matters should be dealt with, their priorities and understanding of the issues, preferences for candidate’s demographics, experience, and disposition, and their deal breakers/more flexible stances. 

For candidates with unique proposals and strategies, ask voters what their preferred approach to a certain issue is and list the specific ideas as multiple choice options that can be ranked.

6060,Block the entrance to Hudson Bay (Canada). Eventually it will all become fresh water.,"Can't remember where I read it, but there's a net flow of fresh water from Hudson Bay to the rest of the ocean (by a small amount). 

What that means is if you blocked Hudson bay from the rest of the ocean (by building a dam between Baffin Island and Quebec, as well as a smaller dam in the Northwest passages), you could prevent Hudson bay from mixing with the salt water of the ocean, and eventually fresh water would displace the salt water entirely. You could put the dam just a few metres above sea level and Hudson bay water will trickle into the ocean. With a bit more height you could get some hydroelectricity, though that's not the point.

You could speed up the process by building a pipe from the bottom of the ocean to slightly above sea level and through the dam below it's height - the water at the bottom will be saltier than the water on top. 

It would have very negative effects on the aquatic life in Hudson Bay, but freshwater ecosystems are more productive generally and we could have something like a much larger Lake Baikal or Lake Superior. You'd also get more albedo in winter to make up for global warming.

But the main benefit is that it will significantly increase the amount of fresh water on earth. You might even be able to get some of it to the arid parts of the USA with a few pipes and pumps.

It will be horribly expensive (the Hudson Strait is deep), but don't underestimate the value of fresh water. Plus, you now have a bridge between Iqualuit and the rest of Canada (though you'd need to build a lot of roads in North Quebec)

We also carefully hide cameras and microphones throughout the city.

We evacuate the entire city, except for this one person. Everyone just quietly slips out overnight. We don't tell them or let them know in any way.

By spinning it fast the centrifugal force stops it from collapsing into a sphere due to gravity. Of course inhabits on this kind of world would actually notice the centrifugal force as it would kind of alter the perceived amount of gravity on different parts of the planet. The reason why such structures don’t form naturally (or at least they are so rare that we will probably never find one) is because astroids can easily stop their formation or slow them down to much when they hit them causing them to collapse. Basically they are fragile. However we have the ability to create much stronger materials and advanced systems that could make this more stable and safe.

6133,Movie idea! Title: Planet Penis,"Back at the dawn of human kind on earth, homo sapien males wandered penis-less. 

A species of aliens from Planet Penis, shaped like a penis, came to Earth in a last ditch attempt to ensure the survival of their species. Their planet had become unstable. They found Homo sapiens to be ideal hosts. Transported majority of their ranks to earth, where each took a human male as their host, while a selected few went back to try stabilize the planet for a future return of everyone. The bigger of the alien species landed in Africa. 

Over time, through evolution, these penis aliens fused and became one with homo sapien males. 

Present century, the returned aliens managed to stabilize their planet’s atmosphere. They return to Earth, make contact with humans and announce their intentions. World-wide panic, chaos ensues. World is on a standby for war. Aliens kidnap a few human males, but cannot figure out a way to detach their comrades.

World’s leaders band together, but are conflicted on whether to attack right away.

Comes an old timer, who had kept the knowledge, passed down from his ancestors about a secret sect of aliens detached themselves from their hosts all those thousands of years ago once their more extremist of the faction returned home. They isolated themselves for centuries.

One commander in US military hopes that maybe, the penis wanting aliens might accept this handful of their remaining species to go back to their home planet and start anew/build from this smaller population back again. Other world leaders want to fully annex the alien ship. 

Now it’s a race against time for the US commander to go convince these isolated aliens to go back home so both their species can have a chance to survive. They finally agree, the extremist aliens accept the reality that they lost their people back when they brought them to earth and will have to build anew. 

Most human penises saved.

6188,Make rental empires illegal,"Housing prices are going up and up. I'm in Texas where cost of living is supposed to be cheaper than other places, and yet nowadays I can't find an efficiency for less than $900/month. I was hoping to move out of this apartment and into a rental house next year, but I can't find a house less than $1300/month. Now a lot of people are renting out individual rooms for $400-600, which is even more offensive to me. I'm sure if I moved out to a small town I could probably find cheaper, at the cost of drastically fewer career opportunities, likely lower wages, and less access to entertainment or much of anything.

A lot of people are hoping the housing market will crash, bringing sale and rental prices down. But the reality is that as soon as this happens, rental companies and wealthy people hoping to start a rental empire (in other words, people who already have investment capital) will buy everything up at the new low prices, and keep rental prices high since they dominate the market. The last hope for a lot of people to ever own a house dies with this fact, and that just isn't right to me.

My possibly unethical solution: ***make rental empires illegal***

I'm not saying make rentals illegal, I think someone should be allowed to own two or three rental properties. And I'm not saying to outlaw apartment complexes either, I would consider an apartment complex to be one rental property in the context of this law. There would need to be legal jargon to avoid loopholes like having multiple subsidiary companies all owned by a larger company, but the goal would be to make sure that no single group could control more than a few rental properties.

If this were the case, companies and rich people wouldn't be allowed to buy up all the cheap real estate if/when the housing market crashes, and the people could actually have access to affordable housing. This would be a game changer for so many less privileged people.",jedimaster4007,1629140932

Only chariytable donors should hold political power. Taxes should noyt exist.. We would collect revenue for the government by bundling services like access to roads or public transportation with required contributions to things like education or welfare. 

The more you donate to charity, the more political power you would get as long as the money was given to those poorer than you. 

The reason this is good is because power should go to the best. These chariytable donors prove how selfless they are by giving at least 30% of income away to registered charities anonymously. The legion of charitable givers would own power in society and ensure that it was used well, with being a contributor required to vote for any office at any level. They would determine what types of contributions were required, how they would be bundled and how the budget would be dispersed. They would select the leader of the business association and create media. The business association would collect ""taxes"" by offering discounts to charitable givers and following regulations, earning a seat at the regulators' table by being a good member of society and otherwise following the rules. 

The society would decide what tests were needed to run for political office or head an agency, looking for virtuous characteristics like

Love, righteousness, service, kindness, generousity, empathy, ability to cooperate and mediation. 

Charitable time or money given is the only way to objectively determine how good a person is. 

Charitable givers in an area would select the chief reasoner and validator, testing all those who seek power in any organization why they seek it and their background with a lie detector test.

6350,"A legit Broadway production of the Simpson's ""Oh Streetcar"" from the episode ""A Streetcar Named Marge.""","Musical comedies time and time again have shown to work. Trey Parker and Matt Stone made the book of Mormon. What better way to create a Simpsons musical from an episode of the early seasons? The songs are there, they just need to be lengthened and rewritten. In addition, I feel like the depth of the episode about Homer treating Marge and realizing her value could be explored, such as a song about how much Homer hates Flanders, Marge never being listened too (she mentions the Monorail, the Dome Incident (Simpsons timeline is weird) , and other things. A B-story of course is through the Simpson kids, combining elements of Marge in the Fast lane. They think Marge is getting together with a widow Flanders and leaving Homer, and how Bart pranks for attention or to escape the anxiety of divorce. Throw in conflict, with Homer running onto stage doing the Marge ""Stella!"" bit. He beats up the theater troupe and carries Marge off Stage a-la Phantom of the Opera style. He confesses love for Marge and why he was wrong before he is comically sedated like King Homer. The musical in musical ends, and then the family go back home to the iconic couch where a groggy Homer wakes up with family around. Wizard of Oz type joke about dream of the entire musical and his family being around. Homer looks at TV, says ""what's this crap we're watching?"" He clicks the remote. Boom, curtains close and then curtain calls. The episode isn't the most iconic, but it cleanly ties theater with the episode, and I just love this idea. SpongeBob did it, Charlie Brown did it. Now let the Simpsons do it. Now, I don't know how the characters will look, but if the acting is good enough, the cast will not be wearing foam, but just be people with tweaks like Marge's blue hair and a take on their classic clothing.

6395,I ran a little experiment...,"I'm sure some of y'all have heard the claim that there is enough cyanide in just two cherry pits to kill an adult human. After doing some research, I decided to test this on my own. I have a chemistry hobby I run on the side and have worked with cyanide salts before, so I synthesized some isopropyl nitrite to hold me over until the ambulance got to me just in case anything went wrong.  I'm a bit of a risk taker so with how doubtful I was that the pits would really poison me and my accessibility to one of the antidotes I felt comfortable enough to run a little experiment. DO NOT TRY THIS, IT ISN'T SMART. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS INVOLVED AND I VERY WELL COULD HAVE GOTTEN LUCKY. THIS IS MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, NOT TO BE REPEATED! Anyway, I started with what I had heard the lethal dose was. According to my research and understanding of how cyanide effects the body, I was very confident that two cherry pits would almost certainly do nothing, so I split them open, extracted the kernels, and then chewed them both thoroughly and swallowed. These were red sweet cherries from Aldis by the way. I tasted the familiar taste of benzaldehyde, a compound I'm very familiar with, so I knew that some cyanide had been released from the cyanogenic glucosides, specifically amygdalin, in the pits. My tongue went a bit numb and the mash was slightly bitter, but even after 10 minutes of waiting I felt absolutely nothing. So I decided to push it a little further. I took 10 cherry pits, extracted the kernels, and ate them all at once. I waited 10 minutes once again and thought I might have experienced a slight headache, but I'm sure it was just placebo. Now very confident, I decided to sit down with a bowl of 20 whole cherries and eat them, chewed up pits and all, while watching tv. It took me about 15 minutes to finish the bowl, and once I did I stood up to walk to my room. I immediately got a throbbing headache and noticed tingling in my hands when I moved them. After a few seconds I got very light headed and began to see stars, which really worried me. I eventually made it to my room where the nitrite was and dialed 91 into the phone just in case things got worse. However, over the course of 30 minutes, the only other symptom I felt was fatigue and the headache and tingling eventually went away. I am now 3 hours removed from ingesting any cyanide and feel fine. So in total I consumed 32 sweet cherry pits and experienced only mild symptoms of cyanide poisoning. I personally attribute this the the wide variability in amygdalin concentrations in nature, and the fact that I'm under 20 and in good health. The claim that two pits can kill you is wildly exaggerated in my opinion, but cherry pits do certainly contain enough cyanide to cause noticeable effects if you eat a bowl full. To finish, I know this whole thing was very stupid and irresponsible of me to carry out, and me posting it on the internet is not in hopes to encourage or embolden anyone else to try anything like this. I simply thought this was a very interesting experience, and my intentions are more in line with Cody's in this video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6hOVhQQ9hI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6hOVhQQ9hI)

What makes a poison is the dose. So please, try and refrain from blasting me in the comments for how stupid I am, I am very well aware of the risks that I took. All that those kinds of comments accomplish at this point is making the commenter feel better, smarter, and safer than me in an ego-boosting kind of way. I think that's just stupid so I'll ignore those if I get them. Once again, to reiterate, DO NOT TRY THIS. Other cherries or stone fruits can contain different levels of cyanide that could be potentially dangerous, and most people don't have access to ANY antidote. What I did was reckless and this post is for educational purposes only!",Laneri751,1628648179

6397,A global power grid could solve climate change.,"The world runs massive cables to every country and effectively make a global power grid / power market. This could potentially be a key to solving climate change. 
  
&amp;nbsp;  

Nuclear and renewables working together are our best possible solution to significantly lower global green house gas emissions. There are all kinds of problems with them but a global power grid could solve most of the biggest ones. Some problems with renewables are that they can't run all the time, we have a hard time storing needed power for later... Some problems for nuclear are peoples perception of them, technology, capability of building them in some countries.   


&amp;nbsp;  
The global power grid would allow countries at night to pull excess from countries in the day (solar), windy places could send excess to the grid. Places where solar is better suited (areas with more sun in the day) could send excess power to the grid. Places where Hydro is well suited could send excess to the grid. Nuclear is looked down a lot on today from the accidents in the past, some countries though have realized the potential behind nuclear and how it isn't that unsafe under the right circumstances. 
Countries where nuclear is publicly accepted could make more reactors than they would need usually and turn it into a source of revenue for the country while also supporting green energy by sending power to the grid.   
   
&amp;nbsp;    
The grid would help solve the storing power problem. By having a constant need for energy around the world, we wouldn't need to store it, because it could go right to work. You may also ask why would countries want to do this? This is why we add a market to the mix, it allows places where green energy is cheaper to build more energy producing equipment and sell to the grid/market. This would drive down the price of renewable energy in places where renewables wouldn't work well and help move them to green energy. Currently we live in a money and profit based world, by creating a market you allow profit focused people and companies to make money by creating green energy. On the more extreme scale there could be regulation on buying/selling dirty energy, for example, taxes, banning from the grid, extra fees for buyer and seller.",2017-CBR1000RR,1628643766

6420,"The citizens of DC have long wished for statehood. Their license plates even say, ""taxation without representation."" Grant the citizens of DC their wish in the most monkey's paw way possible. Grant them statehood. Mexican statehood.","The people of DC have long lobbied for statehood. Well let's finally give it to them. They've always said they wanted statehood, but they usually don't mention what type of statehood. Normal US statehood is just inferred.

The federal government can't just transfer a territory that's presently in a state to a foreign nation. Congress can't combine, split, or change the borders of any state or states without the consent of the legislatures of all the states involved. But good news! DC isn't a state. The district is federal land not within the borders of any state. Thus, the federal government could sign it away in a treaty, like any other federal territory.

We'll carve out some core areas of the district such as the Capitol building, the White House, National Mall, etc and keep those as the now-reduced district. The rest of the land in the district's old boundaries will be sold to Mexico for the price of a single Mexican peso. It will be sold as part of a treaty which also requires the Mexican government to give the citizens of DC full Mexican citizenship and proper representation. 

It's a solution that will make everyone mad! Democrats will hate it, because they won't get the Congressional districts and Senate seats that regular DC statehood would come with. Republicans will hate it because we just created another land border with Mexico. The residents of DC will hate it, because, ""look, we have nothing against Mexico. But this clearly isn't what we had in mind, and it makes no sense at all."" 

Anyone traveling to DC will hate it because of the travel difficulties this will create. Remember, only a few key federal buildings will remain as US territory. This will not include any of the DC area's airports, as those are outside of the current district's boundaries. Thus, if you want to visit the Capitol building you'll first have to fly to the DC area. Then you'll drive to the Mexican border and go through Mexican customs. You then drive through Mexico until you get to the greatly reduced district boundaries immediately around the federal buildings. Finally, you have to go through US customs to visit the Capitol. Anyone visiting the US Capitol will have to go through customs 4 times (there and back), potentially all in a single day! 

Thus, the perfect solution to the DC statehood problem! It resolves a perennial flaw in the US electoral system, while it simultaneously manages to make everyone completely miserable in the process.",isleepinahammock,1628587375

6455,Mandate inverters in electric cars and pay people to let the power company use some of their battery to stabilize the grid,"Renewables have a problem - The sun only shines during the day, wind only works when there's wind... so we need a way to store energy to stabilize the grid so we don't have blackouts. This is a big excuse to keep coal power plants around since they can be on at any time.

Require inverters in all electric cars so you can plug the car into the wall to provide energy in addition to the usual charging. Bonus, not much more expensive to make that power available to the driver so they'll have an outlet available to plug stuff into.

The government could subsidize the extra cost. That would be like $200-$400 per EV conservatively which is small compared to the existing $7,500 federal tax credit in the US. Plus power companies would probably lobby for this so they don't have to buy their own batteries or other energy storage.

It could be set up so you can select how much you're willing to provide. You get paid to provide energy until your car is as low as 80% charged, we'll say. If you're not planning on needing much range, maybe 50% or 30%.

6489,There should be about 4 types of cars available to the general public,"The vast majority of people drive cars that car enthusiasts describe as “appliances.” This population, if they have the means, have largely adopted crossover SUVs as their vehicles of choice. 

In an ideal situation, there are about 4 cars sold to the general public. A sedan, a crossover SUV, a pickup with genuine hauling capacity, and a Jeep Wrangler type small utility vehicle. Now, these 4 cars have nearly infinite customization options. If you want to turn that sedan into a sports car fast drop top coupe, you can. Just gotta pay for it.
All of them are electric btw.
The idea is that by having 90% of people on the same vehicle platforms, the parts interchangeability goes bonkers. Car repairs get really cheap as everyone mostly has the same cars.

6506,The UN need to form a Committee for the Managed Decline of Earth as part of Climate Change initatives,"The covid pandemic has shown that while we have some great scientific abilities, enough of the general public will not adopt their recommendations quickly enough to avoid the deadly consequences of the virus.  Many people in countries where vaccines are freely and widely available are only now getting vaccinated when their friends are actually dying of Covid.

The public reaction to the climate change problem is the same.   Except the scientific recommendations are much more painful to adopt.  When we reach the ""friends dying"" point, it will be too late.  

Unlike covid there is no last-minute vaccine to allow you escape the consequences.   Unlike covid there is a tipping point when its too late for everybody.  Thats gonna happen.

We are f\*cked.  The most dire predictions of climate change is gonna be realised, the planet is gonna become largely inhospitable for human life.   

So we need to start planning for a managed decline.  To try avoid pointless wars.  To migrate large populations to ""safer"" areas.   To share out dwindling food and water supplies as evenly as possible.  To reduce the population.  To plan for less public services.  To enable deaths to be as comfortable as possible.  To react to a limited supply of young people.   And maybe, even, to plan for a new growth when the worst is over.",rye_212,1628372623

If we added a 13th month and filled it with the days required to bring the existing months down to 28, there would be exactly four weeks in a month and no one would need tricks to remember the irregularly fluctuating 30/31 lengths.
There would be 1 or 2 days left over, but we could just call that New Years and give everyone the holiday and hold it separate between Deuxcember and January. Which would add a 14th category to numerical dates and quiet down the triskaidekaphobic.  If we need to name the NYE weekender as if it were a month, I suggest Pluto.

They get a government issued home and a government issued car or truck (their choice.) Both are pretty nice but nothing a middle income family couldn't afford. They are not allowed to move and if they want to trade their vehicle they are issued a new one instead. They are cut off from any savings, investments, etc they may have had prior to taking office.

All utilities, maintenance costs, etc are free for home and vehicle. Healthcare is free, so is dental. They can go into basically any grocery store and get anything they want for free. Once a week, someone comes by and tidies the place up. They can elect to also have someone come in once a week and cook a week's worth of meals for them if they are hopeless at cooking or something.

Essentially, almost all their needs are met, comfortably, but not extravagantly. Keyword is needs here.

For all other incidentals, they get a weekly stipend equal to working 40 hours minimum wage. This is theirs to blow on whatever they want. If they want more, they all have to vote to raise the minimum wage.

6570,Damn an entire mountain,"I live near the Rocky mountains, and while damns like the Hoover damn are pretty impressive…

My idea is to turn an entire mountain range into a greenhouse/dam. Water can’t get out by evaporation, and you can grow plants on the whole mountain, and water that falls on the roof of the greenhouse is collected in collection pipe lines right at the height that the rain hit the mountain.

Those pipes connect to as many collection tanks as we need for storage but more importantly, they go down as far as we need them to go for an efficient water pressure to power massive “dam-like” generators all along the range, powering the entire community.

The crazy part of this is that you can actually do it! If you install even a small portion of this at the top of a mountain, and the pipes all the way down with the generator at the bottom, it will start paying dividends immediately by making sellable energy. Not to mention that you can grow all your own food.

So basically, with a few million to start, and a granola engineer to keep it running while they’re living on the job site and growing their own food, you can just wait for it to make enough money to expand down the mountain, where you can grow more produce, and generate more dam-mountain/greenhouse-energy.

6574,"I’m feeling a wee bit manic, I can’t sleep, and this is what my insomniac mind started to think about.","What if I could do an ideal cover, complete with music video, of Riptide by Vance Joy? I know — girl on a ukulele playing Riptide doesn’t sound original or interesting, but hear me out because my brain kept me awake with this and I think I need to get it out.

The video starts with me sitting crossed leg on a white background and a ukulele on my lap, ready to play. Next to me is a dentist, standing. I start playing the first line, and the screen goes pitch black at the “and the dark”. Lights come back and the dentist is replaced with a pretty girl and there is a row of maybe three people standing behind me with their backs turned. Theybturn around to show their faces are painted green as the appropriate line is sung, and then a magician comes prancing along in front of me, does some kind of quick trick, and then leaves on the other side of the screen. Screen goes black just before the “Ooo” in the chorus and back to just me sitting against a white background for the chorus. Second verse: a cowboy makes an appearance — enters one side, leaves on the other, perhaps towards the Statue of Liberty. Then the camera drops down and zooms out at “she’s been sitting on the highest shelf” to reveal me sitting on a shelf and all the other “characters” in the song doing their respective things on other shelves — a bit how you might imagine toys come to life as a child. Again, dark before the chorus and basically the exact same white background set up. Then for the outro — because remember this is a FANTASY — Vance Joy enters and sings with me, followed with everyone else who made an appearance. 

I say “me” and “I”, but honestly, there are so many younger and more talented people in the world. It would be so cool if someone else did it. It’s a silly screen play for a song that wouldn’t stop building in my head, along with a million other thoughts that are more practical and doable in real life, so feel lighter after having shared this ridiculous one with anyone who happens to read it.",Jenezzy123,1628215367

6612,Gravity Is Misunderstood,"I have been told what I have been working on is crazy... so lets do this. I have been reworking... pretty much everything really. Lets start with gravity.

Gravity as described does not really exist. Mass does not pull.

Dark energy says that space is expanding in all directions from all point. By default this would force energy collections. You do not need mass pulling things together for mass to collect. We made up gravity to explain why things feel like they fall down, when really it's just getting pushed together by the collective energy of the universe. More massive/dense things get pushed harder, creating the standard density gradient we are used to and the feeling of gravity.

Gravity is down, but only because we made it up to explain the universe pushing. So what does this mean? Nothing, but everything. Same but different. Literally nothing changes but the explanation behind how some things work and it cleans unknown things up quite nicely.

So, no pull of gravity, what happens? Lets do black holes since we don't get them anyways. If dark energy by default causes things with mass to collect and planets, stars, black holes and anything else we see can exist the same as they currently do. They are just pushed together, not pulled together. When things are pushed together by dark energy the energy emitted from the heat/decay of matter and the million other things emitting energy outwards from the earth causes it to push back enough to maintain a stable structure. 

Now lets have a cascading failure of energy being able to push back. A star collapse. Same process to create a black hole that we currently have but the moment the energy within a single point is enough to punch a hole in the fabric of space is when things go from ""who knows"" to ""I know"". The energy from that single point, a singularity is enough to push the fabric of space back. The universe pushed so much energy into a point that the point pushed the fabric of space outwards. This is more of a bounce than anything and the amount of matter/energy forced into the singularity determines how far the fabric of space bounces outwards. I haven't looked it up (if we even observed it happen since the supernova is a bit bright...) but when a black hole is created there should be a hell of a ""bounce back and forth"" of the event horizon as the singularity and the universe find a stable boundary. No clue how long it would last but would be heavily dependent on where it is and it's starting ""mass"", but I would think it's quick as fuck at best.

So now we have a singularity that is emitting it's energy and pushing the fabric of space outwards in all directions. It's enough to maintain the hole but will gradually lose that energy. The energy is not consumed by the pushing back, but just transferred through the event horizon as hawking radiation. If more energy gets pushed it, it grows. If things calm down then eventually the universe has enough push back to close the event horizon. Now what...?

Well now we have a singularity exposed to the fabric of space. This singularity still has energy depending on where it was when the universe won the push of war. That singularity is still pushing against the fabric it's within. Dark energy is just the energy emitted by singularities exposed to the fabric of space. Tricky to see as it's just a point but it is there doing stuffs. As it's exposed to the fabric of space. Dark Matter is exposed singularities from closed black holes. Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Singularities are all the same thing, and blackholes are just singularities that are so energetic that they can push the fabric of space open. Not super important but... what inside a black hole? The same nothing we assumed before. It's nothing, the absence of things... other than the singularity. Unsure of if time exists within but I would guess not and the transfer of energy to the event horizon would be ""instant""... due to the lack of time and all.

Gravity is an illusion, but the universe I created is literally no different. We made up gravity just like we made up maths... as a tool to try to understand the universe. It's still a useful tool even if not entirely correct when you don't want to consider literally everything in the universe, which is pretty much all the time. I did a weird and made gravity ""not exist"" and I have spent a month working out so much potential fun stuff. Nothing we see changes, some things are explained a little different but the things that are possible are so much more fun.

That is about as crazy as my ideas get. Assuming this is more correct, we have some fun stuff coming. I am going to bed so I will see how crazy this really is in the morning.",GamingWithRyan,1628132743

So I have been sitting on a piano bench and switching between various yoga positions while working.  There are a good number of yoga positions that don't interfere with typing. For example, half lotus, shoestring, interior leg rotation (don't know the name of this one)

6712,"A movie where a human is raised in a house/room, isolated from the outside world for the entire life","Hear me out:

*A movie where a human is raised in a house/room, isolated from the outside world for the entire life. Think about it, a father and/or a mother gives life to a child, that's raised just in the house. The house has no windows, doors or anything that through which the child could escape.*  

*Imagine only, he wouldn't know about anything else, that there are other children/humans, animals, places, basically the outside world. His conception will be that this is the actual life - that he lives in one room / house.* 

*But here's the ""twist"". The parent/parents are abusive. They make their child a slave and influence him that it's normal to listen to them and do everything they say, maybe even abuse him sexually and saying that's a normal behavior and it's a part of the life. Because no external influence, he will think that's normal and he will obey.*

*As he grows, he starts questioning himself and wondering if that really means the life. One night, he watches the air vent and he wonders where the air is coming from. He waits for the parents to be asleep and he tries to unscrew the vent and successfully does that, but he hears one of his parents wake up and he stops immediately. Then he continues next night and he crawls a long air vent and he finally sees: a peek of the outer world. He's shocked. He returns back after a few minutes.*

*Everyday he thinks about what he saw. He's too scared to try and go again through the vent, because he's afraid to be caught.*

*Few year passes and he's a teenager. He's still thinking about the idea of the outer world. One day he hears for the first time in his life, a very loud bang from the vent and he finally decided to try to go through the vent again and check what was that. He waits for the night and does that.*

*At the end of the vent, he sees that the grill is bent, caused by an explosion. He thinks for a moment and tries to push the grill with his hands. Unsuccessfully, he then tries to kick it with his foot and manages to remove it. From the vent to ground, there are a few meters, but down there are some bushes and he jumps on them.*

6714,Consciousness in machines?,"So I have a philosophical idea that I would like to discuss with you guys. I'm gonna try to put it foward in as short of a text as I can manage. All right, here it goes.

So, would in a hypotetical scenario, a hypotetical machine that mimics every single human function, even down to the atomic level, be considered alive? Would such a machine experience what we call consciousness?

If not, then why? And in that case, what exactly distinguishes us human beings from those hypotetical machines except our biological structure? Does the ''real'' experience of consciousness have to be bound to a complex structure of cells such as human beings? What about those hypotetical machines that mimics our functions to the core, aren't they experiencing ''real'' consciousness? And if you say that the consciousness experienced is nothing but a complex set of algorithms, and therefore not ''real'', couldn't we say precisely the same of ourselves? Wouldn't the only difference between a human and such a machine be it's material structure?

What do you guys think? I am not trying to make any claim here. I just want to hear what you guys think about this set of ideas. Would such a machine be considered alive? What it experience consciousness? What exactly is it that makes us humans different?",Araknhak,1627902788

What is a Theory? 

Sum up your observations, and if they REALLY happen again and again, that is a theory that seems to be happening for real.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do people have to do experiments: 

When within a group of people, people are wondering about something, they have to do experiments to find out the answer, because if you REALLY think otherwise…

When within a group of people, people are wondering about something, they don’t have to do experiments to find out the answer, but then if you think this is REALLY ok for you…

If in the end, when within a group of people, people are wondering about something, they don’t have to do experiments to find out the answer, it doesn’t seem to me that they have to be wondering…does it seem to you…?

&amp;#x200B;

When do problems start, and then they never seem to end? 

This happens when people forget, who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about, who KNOW what they are talking about, and who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about…especially if they do that within a group of people, when experiments …HAVE TO be done.

So …how do people remember the above?

&amp;#x200B;

Who are those who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about?

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they don’t know what they are talking about, because if you REALLY think otherwise…

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they know what they are talking about, but then if you think this is REALLY ok for you…

If in the end, when within a group of people, experiments have to be done, and out of all the people in the group, those who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they know what they are talking about, then it doesn’t seem to me that there is something someone doesn’t know in this group, for which experiments have to be done…does it seem to you…?

Excellent…you are learning…keep reading…

&amp;#x200B;

Who are those who KNOW what they are talking about?

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who KNOW what they are talking about, are those who know to wait until they talk, because if you REALLY think otherwise…

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who KNOW what they are talking about, are those who don’t know to wait until they talk, but if you think this is REALLY ok for you…

If in the end, when within a group of people, experiments have to be done, and out of all the people in the group, those who KNOW what they are talking about, are those who don’t know to wait until they talk, it doesn’t seem to me that those ones specifically are wondering about something, for which experiments have to be done…does it seem to you…?

…keep going…the last step is the strangest…

&amp;#x200B;

Who are those who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about?

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they know what they are doing, because if you REALLY think otherwise…

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they don’t know what they are doing, but if you think this is REALLY ok for you…

IF in the end, when within a group of people, experiments have to be done, and out of all the people in the group, those who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they don’t know what they are doing, it doesn’t seem to me that those who REALLY DON’T KNOW what they are doing, are not doing experiments, because the rest people notice this also, neither that the rest people can tell the ones who REALLY DON’T KNOW what they are doing, what they have to do, because they REALLY DON’T KNOW what they are talking about and the rest people notice that also…

…does it seem to you…?

&amp;#x200B;

Because if it does, how else do you think one can within a group of people doing experiments think, while reality is something else than what you can imagine?

Why? Because reality is REALLY happening, and you REALLY don't imagine reality for reality to happen, you can just imagine per case how reality REALLY happens...When do problems start and then they never seem to end in a group of people",AlexandrosTsolis,1627737612

6822,A set of gears with a ridiculously high gear ratio to minimize the recoil felt by a shooter of a gun,"From my (very poor) understanding of how recoil from a gun is caused: the bullet exerts a force on the firing pin. The gas produced by its ejection also pushes the gun backwards.

So we can connect the firing pin/firing mechanism to a gear with a ridiculously high gear ratio (like 1,000,000:1). In this way the gear just turns a very small distance and all the energy is absorbed. No more recoil

6843,All is fair in love and war,"I've recently moved into a new house share with three other guys. It was very last minute but it felt like a good fit as they're all fun, outgoing people. I figured this would help me to socialise and come out of my shell a bit as I generally lack the enthusiasm to meet new people. 

Last week they all drove down to California for a ""screw China weekend."" I had hoped I could join them but they said it'd all been planned for months and it would be difficult to change the bookings. I've had a nightmare before when changing a booking to see my aunt, so I understood. It worked out for the best anyway as they needed someone to look after the three house pets.

One housemate has a ten-year-old Dachshund and another has two tiny Russian hamsters. They're all really cute but traditionally don't get along too well... I was told that an introduction had been attempted and one of the hamsters was nearly lost. When they told me, I felt the energy in the room dissipate. I knew this weekend I had an opportunity.

After they packed the car they gave me a list of dos and don'ts. It was mostly about food, walking, water blah blah blah but they mentioned locking the dog away when giving the hamsters some time outside the cage. I asked ""because they don't traditionally get along?"" and they all frantically shook their heads. They then drove off and I fed the pets.

It was kinda late so instead of spending time with them I decided to watch a movie. I saw Homeward Bound whilst scrolling and thought that was a hella appropriate film for the weekend. It brought back so many childhood memories and I couldn't help but fixate on how there were three animals getting along so well, in stark contrast to my current situation. The pets in the film all seemed so cheerful and reasonable that it gave me the inspiration to try and introduce them properly.

I put a lot of thought into how I was going to do this given the stories I'd heard. I fed them all triple what they usually eat for dinner so they wouldn't be hungry and I put on some classical music because I've heard this has a calming effect on animals. I went to get the hamsters first, put them in their running balls and then took them to the dog's bed.

The dog started snarling as soon as he saw the hamsters. I shouted ""NO! NO!"" and gestured as if to give him a backhand slap. He calmed down a little but still looked angry. I knew that he saw me as an aggressor, which I figured would mean the hamsters were no longer seen as a threat. I threw the two balls at the dog so they could become more familiar and the dog sniffed the balls but seemed fairly calm. 

Phase 1 was a success.

Phase 2 involved actually playing together so I gently kicked the balls and tried to get the dog to fetch them. He didn't really understand at first, so I smeared some peanut butter on them and he started going mental. He loved every moment! He pushed the balls all around the house down to the basement and then he lay next to them. 

By this point it was about 1am so I needed to sleep and so did the pets, thus I initiated Phase 3. 

Having watched Homeward Bound, I knew every good pack sleeps together so they can look out for each other. I took the hamsters out of the cage slowly and the dog remained calm. They were a bit messy from peanut butter seeping through the holes in their balls but I didn't have time to clean them that night so left that job for the next day.

As I turned to leave the room, I heard the dog growl extremely aggressively. I kept walking as a sign that there was nothing to worry about but he got louder. I then heard the hamsters squeal so I looked back fearing the worst. They ran off the bed and the dog chased them, then they managed to get under a cabinet but I could tell the dog was nearly biting them. 

I tried to pull him by his collar and he became aggressive towards me as well and bit my hand. I was upset and offended but luckily I remembered what I was taught in scouts, so I grabbed his two hind legs and tried to spin him for thirty seconds. Tragically, I failed to maintain my balance and we both fell. 

I landed backwards onto the floor but the dog collided with the washing machine. He was out cold. I called the nearest vet but there was no answer. I decided it would be best to wait until the morning to decide the next move. 

The next morning there was still no movement. I drove him to the vets and they declared him DOA (dog on arrival) and then it turned out he was just paralysed and was breathing fine. His eyes were looking at me as if to say ""I shouldn't have chased the hamsters"" and that's when I realised I'd forgotten about the hamsters! 

I rushed back to try and find them. I searched absolutely everywhere and all down the street. I knocked on neighbour's doors and shouted their names for hours. I'd really messed this up but I assumed they would return to the house as they had nowhere else to go.

I sat down on the couch and stuck on Homeward Bound again to try and pick up some more tips as my plan had failed. 

Half-way through I remembered the dog was still at the vets, so I paused the film and drove down with the hope that the vet had managed to fix his ailment. Medicine has come so far that surely a knock on the head would be an easy fix for somebody who did hella years of studying. 

I walked in and said the dog's name. The receptionist didn't understand, so I said the vet's name. She said he's in surgery 4 but with an animal. I told her it's my animal and I walked into the surgery. 

It was some stupid cat. I asked him where the hell my dog was and he said they had to put him down. I went ballistic! ""How can you put down an alive animal, you sick freak?! My housemate is gonna kill me!"" I felt an instant desire for revenge that I had never felt before, so I grabbed the cat from the surgery table and I started choking it. The surgeon and two nurses managed to wrestle me to the floor but it was too late, revenge had already been served.

I got to my feet, wiped myself off and ran back to the house. I sat back down on the couch and tried to think of a way to fix this. I had nothing, so I resumed Homeward Bound hoping that it might finally give me something to work with. 

And then it hit me... These animals weren't anything special like the animals in the film. They were just bog standard, Google images type animals that even their own mother would struggle to recognise. So, I spent the rest of the afternoon driving around pet stores and I found some identical replacements. 

I brought them back home and showed them their new beds. What's best is they didn't mind each other at all. One sniff from the dog and he went back to his chew toy. I realised at this point that I may have finally broken the tradition.

My housemates came back and were so excited to see their pets. The hamsters owner couldn't tell at all and began handling them, but the dog owner looked confused. He kept saying the dog's name and patting his thighs, but it wasn't reacting. He turned to me and asked if he was okay. I frantically nodded and just explained he'd had a lot of peanut butter this weekend. I told him to get some rest and that I'd take the dog for a walk.

I took him round the corner to the local park and knew I had to make use of this time to complete the facade. I grabbed his head and looked deeply into his eyes. ""EDDIE! EDDIE! EDDIE! EDDIE!..."" 

This went on for an hour. I then let him off the lead and ran a few metres. I turned around, patted my thighs and said his new name. 

He ran over! 

We went back to the house and my housemate was still in the living room. ""Eddie!"" he cried, and New Eddie ran over. My housemate looked so happy. 

I told him I'd leave them alone for some quality time and that I'd had a hectic weekend so was gonna get an early night. I felt so relieved. It was all okay in the end.

6894,Empathy,"Why should you care?

About anything?

Why give a damn about the suffering of other people?

Why care? Caring doesn't seem like a good idea because it requires effort and other people might not. But the question isn't why care, it's why refuse? The only reason to care is so that others care about you. Wouldn't the world be better off if people gave a damn and cared about each other? What if someone cared about you first. Its impossible to care about others unless someone else did. It took a lot of love and caring to go into the system Simeon made.
Compare warm nominal and reciprocal to the unfeeling brutality of capital.
People with an I don't give a fuck attitude are cold and brutal- antithetical to the society we want to create where anyone could be a friend and a partner. Such people are a danger to themselves and others and should be locked up.

Apathy itself is a toxic attitude that spreads due to economic conditions and ease of use. Think about competition vs cooperation and nominalism vs capitalism or socialism. When it comes to the suffering of other people, apathy should be criminalized.

So we have three new crimes.

First is a failure to have empathy for those in pain. We shouldn't laugh at the suffering of others unless they are to blame.

Next is a failure to love.

If there is so much goodness and kindness in Society mixed with some hatred and fear, why not love it instead of hating it?

Failure to respond t

To attempts to get you to either have empathy, love or care about others. After the tenth attempt you will be put on trial for prison.

Apathy in others threatens a world where people care about you. Destroy this.

Caring about others protects good people too in the long run. It isn't cool to care. It's warm and joyful.

If say 8 adults pooled their resources while working normal jobs they would be able to afford to live quiet well especially if they were able to make investments together with a bigger sum of money. Or the members wouldnt have to work as much and could thus spend more time investing in themselves perhaps forming their own businesses, or following dreams. The closest things the real world has to it from what I can tell are polycule familys and some small businesses. But neither really capture the platonic camaraderie feeling its suppose to have. (Of course married folk and dating would be allowed but not really be the point.) And in this era of isolation high costs of living, having an option to share the costs and burdens with like minded others  seems like it could be a great solution to a lot of modern problems.

**Rules:**

* The entire production of your movie must take place within the selected time limit. This includes but is not limited to: Writing, story boarding, filming, editing, effects, rendering, animation, and publishing.
   * It is okay to have a team ready and waiting ahead of time, as long as the script, scene list, or other associated documents haven't already been made.
      * Your team can be as big or as small as you like. So long as the selected budget isn't exceeded for the production.
      * Talent can be considered part of the team. HOWEVER the Talent cannot be cast for roles before the challenge starts. Writing is part of the challenge so the actors will have to be cast AFTER the script is written, if it's written at all.
      * You are allowed to secure locations for shooting in advance as getting on the list for shooting on location can take an exorbitant amount of time.
   * The script can be re-written as many times as you want during production, but as long as it happens within the selected time limit.
   * Everything about the movie, except assembling a cast and crew in advance and securing one or more locations to shoot, must occur within the time limit.
* ***No breaking local, federal, or international laws.***
* ***Be safe, do not endanger people!***
* All team members (cast and crew) must be legal adults of the age of 18 years or older, who knowingly consent to participating in the challenge.
* Publishing counts as ""Making the movie available to the public"".
   * This can be either for free or not.
   * You have to publish the movie within the time limit in a verifiable manner, or else it doesn't count.
      * Publishing online counts. (preferred)
      * Showing the movie in a theater counts.
      * Showing the movie to a random stranger on your smartphone counts (as long as you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you did it within the time limit).
      * As long as someone who is not a part of the cast or crew (the team) can view the movie, it counts as publishing.
   * You also have to have proof that you completed the challenge within the time limit, this can be an unedited video feed of the production process, a series of unedited photographs, or some other sort of reliable evidence of the challenge's completion by your team.
* If you fail to finish the production within the time limit, you have to declare (whether in a video description or somewhere also conveniently accessible to the public: ""TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED"")
* The content of the movie can be whatever you want it to be, as long as the content is not illegal.

Maybe it doesn't matter if you believe in a personification of god as a divine being or not. Because acting as if that transcendeal ideal exists is better than the contrary (no matter the religion). The latter being a quick path to nihilism and self-annihilation. I think that more often than not, a bad map is better than none at all. This is not to excuse the atrocities commited by relgion nor all it's dogmatic flaws, in any way shape or form. But my point is that the flaw in the atheistic view is that atheists actually do act, in some ways, as if a transcendal moral judge exists. It's an aged argument, I know, but they do follow a trasncending set of moral laws, the same laws that religious people attribute to a divine being. The only difference being the personification of that transcendent force. So maybe most people that claim to be atheists actually aren't, because being a true atheist would require not acting according to that transcending moral at all. Therefore it maybe doesn't really matter if we believe in a personification of god or not, because most of us act as if we do. So are we really atheistic?

- https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mini-ice-age-is-coming-in-the-next-15-years

If you want to know what it looks like, see the river Thames freezing over for a good idea of this.

After this warming period the Earth has been going through, we may very well see the opposite whereby temperatures drop past their original median (before it started warming).

Much would change but it will not be catastrophic to humanity.

Our main problem is that our energy grids would not be able to handle the drop in temperatures and especially not the much colder winters we would face because of this phenomena (we have seen them fail in colder than expected winters, as well as in hotter than expected summers) so people should be prepared to generate their own electricity or utilize a community wide grid that is not reliant on the larger, say, city-wide grids we rely on.

We generally have the means to grow crops in ways that would not be affected by a radical change in temperatures (should it be necessary) such as some kind of hydroponic farm indoors in a heated environment.

Be prepared for this cooling within the coming years.

We may see much colder winters in some places and the grids just will not be able to handle them. Not to mention the issue of warmth some people may be left without.

If you believe me, please share the word.

Thank you.",Castlefree43,1627219882

7031,Are you a town planner in charge of your city's zoning and building codes? Use your powers for evil and apply them to stir absolute chaos.,"The possibilities are endless!
* Mandate that the maximum lot width is 50 feet and the minimum side building setback is 30 feet.
* Tinker with the zoning code. Declare the interstate highway a residential zone. Declare bars, strip clubs, paper mills, and bank headquarters to be ""residences."" Require that any power plant or factory that produces high mercury emissions to be not a minimum, but a maximum distance from elementary schools and day care centers.
* Divide the city into a series of smaller cities, each with elaborately weaved together borders. Arrange it so every single lot in the current city's boundaries end up inside at least three different cities. You have to deal with 3-4 different property tax assessments and are subject to the jurisdiction of each.
* Sell off Main Street, literally. Take the land occupied by your busiest cross-town thoroughfare, and sell it off to a private developer. Ideally, to really make people mad, make sure it's converted to a really long exclusive golf course or runway for a rich people's commuter airport. Everyone else now has to drive miles out of their way to get passed this stupid golf course or runway where Main Street used to be.
* Reinstate archaic 1950s planning code items including the mandatory use of asbestos or a minimum lead content for paint.
* Don't institute mandatory segregation. Instead legally mandate full integration. Every neighborhood must have the same ethnic makeup as the city as a whole. 
* Declare all the land in the city to be completely covered in access easements and all must be accessible to the general public. It's now perfectly legal to just go camp in someone's yard overnight without their permission. 
* Require all lots to be rectangular with no interior angle measuring angle greater than 85 degrees.
* Require a separate building permit for the construction of roofs during building construction. You can only apply for this permit after the rest of the building, including all interior finishes, is complete. Draw out the roof-permitting process so new buildings sit roofless for years.
* For tracking ownership of each lot, do away with the cumbersome deed system. Just have a community wiki that keeps track of who owns what piece of land. When a property is sold, anyone can just go the site and change its recorded owner. Just like making an edit on Wikipedia. Logins or ID verification will not be required. It will be run mostly on the honor system.
* Not only allow, but mandate the raising of roosters within city limits.
* Turn the dog park into a cat park. Nothing cats like better than meeting other cats!
* Set the maximum height of a building as 39i feet.
* Plat and sell deeds to the bottom of the river.
* Declare that each lot only extends to 10 feet above its currently tallest structure. Then have the city start selling ""air lots,"" volumes literally right above existing lots. Lower lots will have an easement to allow the placement of structural supports for the upper lots. The upper and lower lots will be deliberately offset from each other, so that one cannot simply purchase the air lot right above your current lot. Instead you would have to buy several.
* Mess with the zone boundaries for each elementary school. Set half of them to have boundaries so small that they literally only cover the elementary school's own footprint. Set the other half to twice the size as before. Leave the same number of teachers as present. Half the schools are teachers speaking to empty classrooms. The other half are crowded to beyond bursting and have teachers so overworked they routinely literally collapse in front of their students.
* Mandate that all structures must be located at the lowest point on a lot, as thus to maximize flooding. 
* Decorate all city medians and road verges with plant life. Specifically bamboo. Mandate that all houses maintain a green lawn, and that bamboo is not allowed outside of the road verges, enforced with a large fine.
* Have pedestrian crosswalks protected by big railroad crossing-style tilt arms. Allow a pedestrian to lower them simply by pressing a button. As soon as the button is pressed, the gates will instantly slam down under their full weight. (We'll rely on the pedestrian to time it so the arm doesn't hit any cars.) Don't include any automatic lift mechanism; just have a button pedestrians press on the other side to raise the bar back up. (Again, going with the honor system here.)
* Create loops of one-way streets that cars can enter, but can't ever legally leave. 
* Plat out a massive planned community with tens of thousands of homes. Instead of a grid of streets, have all the buildings on a single continuous giant spiral, of width no more than the average suburban residential street. Set the speed limit in the neighborhood to 5 mph. Anyone who lives in the center has to spend hours puttering along at 5mph just to get out of the neighborhood. Construct this neighborhoods with no pedestrian paths. The only way in or out is to drive the spiral. 
* Mandate that the ratio between the square footage of a first and second story must be -2.",isleepinahammock,1627198993

Also if a property generates big amounts of income (e.g. because it consists of 30 flats) then the amount you can earn is also limited. (you will need to sell some flats)

Secondly, it would be a more entertaining watch in my mind, a 100 m run would be more fun to watch with a diverse group of athlete's imo.

Something I've seen floating around the internet that would be implemented would be no drug tests, allowing athletes to reach the peak physical fitness possible. This will work well with the theme of Titans, as they were also larger and more powerful than the Olympians. Another internet idea to implement would be having an average person compete alongside the athletes.

Location would also be different. Instead of a new city being chosen each year, the games would cycle between 12 (arbitrary number) major cities, 6 for summer and 6 for winter. Rather than having to build new infrastructure for every game (which often is never used again afterwords), the chosen cities would have permanent stadiums and venues.

To keep things from getting stale, after every Othryon the least popular sport is removed. A new sport voted in my the spectators will then be added to the roster to replace the old one (goodbye curling, hello competitive glizzy gulping).

7105,Useful app ideas," Hello fellow Redditors!

I like reading about ideas for all kinds of different apps and even though I forget most of them, I still like to keep a shortlist of ideas I think could help a lot of people and generate a lot of income.

Here are some of them:

**Handyman app** \- There are a lot of posts and sites about making a handyman app, but I never managed to find a working app to see how it functions. But the idea seems too good to pass on, a lot of people are not equipped with the tools to fix and maintain an entire house or an apartment, just as a lot of people don’t have cars and are using transport services. This could both save time and money for companies who are just waiting for people to call them. Just think about how simple the steps could be – you download an app, something breaks, you take a picture, send it over the app, the company sends their team to your house, they fix it, you pay it over the app, and all done. Of course, I am over-simplifying here, but you get the idea. It could even be set up as a subscription-based model, so you have ‘’free’’ repairs while you pay the sub.

**On-demand-fuel-delivery app** – Imagine you run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. Alone, no idea where the next gas station is, and even if you do, you probably don’t have your canister and have to buy it to fill it, and that’s IF you find a gas station. Luckily, we have GPS nowadays and we know exactly where the gas station is. But what if you don’t want to leave your car? What if it’s the middle of the night and you have to walk at least half an hour to the nearest one? This app could be designed in a way that the user shares his GPS location and the type of fuel the vehicle uses. The team drives to your location and provides you with fuel. This could also be integrated in existing tow-truck service apps.

**Mushroom identifier app** – Probably not the most popular idea out there, this app could potentially save lives. There are existing websites that offer community-based identification for plants and mushrooms, but what if we used Ai for it? What if we teach a machine to recognize poisonous ones and alerts us shortly after we take a picture? If you know about some existing apps like this, feel free to share!

**Original or not app** (for clothing brands) – Ever bought some clothes that turned out to be fake? What if there was a way to identify the original brand from fake ones? Is it possible to create a database and fill it with barcodes or some other detail that is unique to the original product and visible to the consumer, so that we can use that database to scan the product to determine its originality? Never found much info on apps like this. If you did, let me know.

What were your favorite app ideas that changed people's lives or helped you in any way? What ideas would you like to see made reality?",dailyidea,1627071450

7220,What if video game licenses were sold (kind of) like stock shares online?,"**With my probably elementary school level understanding of economics (not an expert at all),** I just randomly came up with this idea after watching enough videos on the AAA industry. The point I want to make is that this could, in a simple capitalistic setting, promote accountability for video game quality by setting prices as controls, and using a check and balance system to keep all parties (consumers, developers, distributors, media) fair. **This is a replacement model for the current system of selling prices based on sticky physical video game copies.**

# Differences from Actual Stock Shares

1. Only one license, or share maximum per consumer. Licenses can only be traded to those without one. Distributors would need measures against holding multiple accounts.
2. Developer and media exclusive licenses would be excluded from trading practices, to prevent shady manipulation.
3. License price would *decrease* from initial listed price as more consumers buy, though only to a final stable price. Likewise it would *increase* back to the maximum price as first listed when consumers sell for a refund and profit or deficit.
4. Trading period for licenses is time sensitive, equal to around one development cycle, so a developer would move from one video game to the next. After the period is over, prices are frozen, refunds are ended, and only trading between consumers is allowed.

# Without Further Ado, The Model

First, deals are negotiated between the developer and media conglomerates (i.e. IGN belongs to J2 Global, Kotaku belongs to G/O Media), or in the near future influencer networks (groups with buying power of Twitch streamers, YouTube content creators, etc.) to buy exclusive rights to an upcoming video game. This could happen anytime during the development cycle, and involves the usual early access, review before release, maybe insider scoop perks, etc. In exchange, enough total capital is raised to cover almost to about the entire amount of development costs. The terms of these deals should be made transparent by each media group who sign on.

Next, the video game will be listed on an online distributor (Steam, or Epic Games lol) by release. There are two types of variables to discuss, prices and percent rates:

1. The initial or maximum listing price is mostly affected by the other variables in deal negotiations. There is no explicit bias towards higher or lower pricing, as I will explain later.
2. The depreciation rate from initial to final price is nonnegotiable and set by the distributor. This becomes a talking point in negotiations when...
3. ...it determines the speed at which the final stable price is reached. From the initial to final price, sales revenue will almost 100% go towards the developer, with a flat rate service fee to the distributor. After the final price is reached, two values for licenses emerge, the stable market price and the hidden depreciating price. The hidden depreciating price will continue to measure per sale the source of revenue to developers until it hits the minimum currency value then flat lines. Subtracting the hidden price from the stable price becomes the source of revenue for the distributor and each media group that signed a deal, according to two separate rates set by the distributor.
4. The distributor rate adds to the flat rate service fee an incremental one until hidden price bottoms out. However, the distributor cannot collect on this revenue until the end of the trading period, in order to counter balance malicious selling. More on this later.
5. The media rate is also incremental, beginning from the final price until hidden price bottoms out. In negotiations, media groups will want a higher final price and shorter range to the initial price in order to collect on revenue faster. Developers would prefer a lower final price and longer range in order to protect against malicious selling or other worst case scenarios.
6. Distributors could compete in the market by offering different depreciation, distributor, and media rates. Of course the higher media rates in general will look the most attractive, however this would be in exchange for a lower distributor rate and put developers on thin ice.
7. How a higher distributor fee acts as a cushion for developers is holding the revenue for refunds. Because after the final price developers are only earning equal to the hidden price per sale, yet licenses held by consumers are equal to the final price before adjustments, refunding will result in a loss per selling consumer (maybe not as bad as I think in a normal situation, have not calculated anything). In the case of malicious inflation of consumer licenses before mass selling for profit however, the revenue refunded from the distributor fee acts as a buffer while an investigation can take place. Distributors should be able to accept or reject refunds in order to regulate market transactions, and also hold developers accountable.

Say a developer is acting in bad faith under this model. The media would probably still hype up their video game in order to hit the final price target and collect on revenue before everything blows up. But once the consumer realizes their video game is broken, license refunds or ""selling shares"" start flying. If the final price has already been passed, every refund up to the market price rising back above final will be a loss for the developer. Distributors can allow this to happen and stand for consumer advocacy, or at best stall for time deducting refunds from the distributor fees. **Ideally, enough of a loss is incurred to kill all profit, and at worst threaten bankruptcy for developers playing it high risk. If the media does their job properly and points out the problems, then developers can work on fixing them while being able to pay their employees from the deals already negotiated.**

This is exacerbated by ways of inflating the license price. In a similar vein to preorder bonuses, consumers can pay extra on top of the license price they purchase, at any time, in exchange for exclusive DLC or just ""pay what you want"" for appreciation (capped so no destabilization from massive inflation). Every time extra is paid for, all license prices held by consumers at purchase increases collectively as divided evenly, which remains separate from the stable market price of new license purchases. The consumer license prices increase cumulatively per extra payment, so a license purchased at a later date would immediately increase to match the most updated price as held by existing consumers. The more licenses purchased after final price with extra payments, even more loss is incurred. This could lead to quick consumer profit schemes, so again distributors have to regulate by preventing malicious actors and bot accounts from exploitation.

# Other Parties Outside the Model

Different demographics of consumers can be sorted by time of purchase within ranges of the license market price.

1. Those who purchase closer to the initial listing price would most likely be the fans of a franchise, or similar to gacha whales for being willing to spend big and keep a game afloat. This becomes the safest demographic to target by developers, because their refunds would result in little to no loss while only holding a small portion of ""shares"" at their purchase sizes. Loyalty should be maintained to ensure this fan base constantly buys licenses early, to overcome the hurdle for introductory consumers to then buy into at cheaper prices.
2. Consumers who buy after the final stable price would likely be new players or casuals (Timmies as TCG designers call them). They also hold the most advocacy power, by causing refunds at a loss for the developer. Easier or harder to sway into action (assuming there are always more casuals in a player base, it better be easier)?

And for media groups too poor to afford deals with developers, they can form a separate tier of watchdog journalism, by establishing contacts within the exclusive media (if NDAs do not just prevent this entirely). This creates separation in the field of video game journalism for more trusted sources without declaring sponsorship because of review copies, which a certain movement may appreciate.

# Would This Really Work?

Probably not, considering the business models of current video game media conglomerates I believe do not generate enough capital to consider dealing with corporations the size of Activision Blizzard and EA, much less pay all of their employee salaries. Also pretty sure AAA developers, or the marketing and management teams at least, are doing just fine rolling in dough generated from all the false advertising and preorders the current system enables. This would benefit indie developers more by getting paid straight up instead of hoping for their breakthrough title. Oh well, this was a fun thought exercise for me at least (however objectively wrong about economics I may be lol).",Cronatsu,1626807344

7261,Replace the Electoral College in the US with one based on Tax Revenue,"In essence, elections would be based on tax revenue over the past two or four years (depending on the election) at a county level, aggregated across the entire state, and later the entire country for senate, house, and presidential elections. If only five counties vote for a certain candidate, but their net contributions over the past election cycle were worth $20 million, then they win the state. However, for presidential elections, victory would be based around garnering the largest amount of tax paying votes. This creates a much higher degree of granularity with regard to voter representation. 

The logic behind this is that giving higher representation to higher tax contributing counties will theoretically make it easier for them to contribute more to the national GDP, and thus uplift poorer counties across the state and country. This would keep the election map dynamic as areas that were not contributors would have their ability to increase employment and industry bolstered, and thus give them more weight in future elections. 

This would also incentivize massive corporations and billionaires to pay more taxes (under the stipulation that we eliminate corporate participation in government), so they can still exert their control, while also giving back to the American people in a big way. Businesses would thus have a reason to set up new businesses in swing counties around the country, providing jobs and more importantly tax dollars to aid in revitalizing dying regions nationwide.",The_Outlyre,1626718837

7274,"Create a ""pure soul"" out of extraterrestrially-resourced substances and materials based on some religion, and do experiments from there","DISCLAIMER: I have an idea of Christianity the most. I mean...it's not surprising, considering how they've systematically become the most popular religion. Not all religions share their aspects, so you're allowed to skip anything redundant or add pertinent stuff. Also, I may be making a big mess.

You will need:

* A religion with standards, preferably with an equivalent of Hell and a paradoxically exploitable law, and any pertinent wisdom associated with it
* A comprehensive understanding of human neurology, genetics and biochemistry
* A self-learning algorithm that has been trained extensively to prevent potentially sinful thoughts from manifesting in a human brain by inhibiting nerve signals before they fully form
* Resources from space that can be used to replicate human life
* A fully-sterilised laboratory, and equipment that can fully isolate the resources so that they do not come into contact with genetic material sourced from Earth

New resources are necessary to circumvent any inherited sin. All matter that has been part of a human are considered contaminated by sin.

Do:

1. Make sure the resources do not come into contact with any terrestrial genetic material.
2. Form them into human stem cells, or a fertilised human egg. This is probably the simplest way of doing it.
3. Connect it to the algorithm before it produces a mind.
4. Sustain the human until it is able to learn.
5. Teach the human the necessary concepts required to comprehend the religion.
6. Teach them to follow the religion. DO NOT introduce them to any canonical contradictions.
7. For an experiment, make them ambiguously violate a religious law. For example, if a religion commands people not to lie, make them say ""this sentence is false"", or some equivalent. (They have to mean it rather than simply follow orders, though.)
8. If a religion grants enlightenment or anything based on specific criteria, conform to them.
9. Conclude the experiment whenever you want and wait for the results

16 is just right for some people; for the rest, however, they are able to be responsible at a much younger age; or they are late-bloomers. Although those not accommodated by the age requirements are a minority, their livelihoods matter as much as those who are benefited by the requirements.

I have an idea that can benefit everyone.

I believe this would cause an influx of American companies to develop residential neighborhoods, industry, and infrastructure in Mexico. Imagine medium income families and entrepreneurs flocking to Mexico for cheaper real estate (since home prices are INSANE now), and Mexican citizens could freely move to American cities or small towns. 

Because of current urban over-population, we could offer rural home loans and once again build population in dying small towns across America. Give all people a 0% down loan with 1 year of deferred payments to repopulate rural communities. Bonus, offer small businesses startup loans. 

Cuba could greatly benefit from increased tourism from free trade and travel. Also, no more killing their own citizens! Cuba could also be a mecca for the classic car market.

7466,"The solution to 9/11 was not to invade Iraq/Afghanistan, instead hiring US Air Marshalls and focusing on domestic in-flight security would have worked better.","The idea would be to hire enough US Air Marshalls that every (or 90% of all) domestic flights would have two Air Marshalls on board (I know every expensive to implement). They would have mace, tazers, knives, and ultimately a handgun in the most extreme of situations. 

When you think about how much money we spent on the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan (NPR reports 20.2 billion dollars was spent annually on air conditioning in Afghanistan.....for 20 years),  hiring Air Marshalls would likely be much cheaper and more practical to implement. Not to mention all of the domestic work opportunities it would provide and all of those people legally paying their taxes every year, we'd all benefit from that approach. The money spent on these domestic Air Marshalls would change hands numerous times, and the net benefit to the economy would be tangible. Whereas, a lot of the money spent on Iraq and Afghanistan was a one way street when the money went to those countries and the average US citizen didn't see much benefit.

Keep in mind the 9/11 hijackers were armed with box cutters, so 2 well trained and well armed Air Marshalls could have easily subdued the hijackers or organized a defense coordinated with the passengers. Plus, if 2 Air Marshalls are on board they can deal with rowdy passengers on the plane much easier than the flight attendants can. 

In my mind this sounds like a legit solution to airplane hijacking, and are variables that the USA largely has control over (instead of trying to control foreign nations). 

Even back in 2001, the concept of a wide scale boots on the ground invasion didn't make much sense, and it was hard to figure out how that was going to make flying safer. Wide scale land invasions don't really work anymore, Korea and Vietnam have clearly illustrated that.",ShabbyJerkin,1626203861

7480,FARMING LEOPARD GECKOS FOR TAIL-MEAT IS HARD,"# IDEA

I had those in my lack of sleep yesterday.

The tails of leopard geckos constitute between 20-30% of a gecko's size, and I presume somewhat like 1/3rd of their weight, let's say we can breed such gecko.  
Each gecko produces  about 30-35g of tail meat, a good portion of 120 grams would need 4 geckos.  
The tails of leopard geckos also regen to a healthy portion within 80 days, so each gecko would be farmed every 80-90 days.  
If we wanna farm 1 tray of gecko tail a day for 250 days of the year, we need 250 x 4 geckos = 1000 geckos, each gecko gets farmed 3x a year, and 1000 geckos alone can produce about 90kg of meat per year.  


The number of geckos you need is the number tail trays you wanna produce over the 1000x geckos. So 20 trays a day are 20k geckos, or 2,4kg per day, and 1,8 tons per year.  


# ABOUT COSTS

1 gecko costs anywhere between 30 to 3000 USD depending on the morph of the gecko, let's get a little above cheap and go for the 50 USD fancy geckos, to obtain 20k fancy leopard geckos we need an initial push of 1M USD.  


Baby geckos need more food more often, about 6 crickets or worms a day for 1 year before they can be farmed.  
Adult geckos however need about 7 crickets **per week** due the lizard metabolism.  
As our geckos will be under regen stress, let's calculate that food for 10 crickets per adult per week.  


Keep in mind stores can ship 1000 crickets for up to 25 USD.  


For the first year, the expends will be on the order of 44 million USD - minus professional and infrastructure costs (which are smol compared to the amount of crickets we just bought)  
The following years, the feeding costs are on the order of 10,4 million USD - minus professional and infrastructure cost.  


The only way we can make this business at least pay itself, is to sell each tail tray for at least 2.080 USD.",Moisty_Amphibian,1626186279

You get to experience it without knowing you’re in a theme park until it’s over.👇🏽,"Your friend/relative surprises you with an international holiday trip, so you pack your bags and go. You fall asleep on the plane en route. Unbeknownst to you, you’ve been drugged so that you don’t even realize you’ve been transported back to land, and into an airplane simulator in the theme park.

You wake up; it’s as if you’ve only been napping for a few minutes. You’re still on the plane. Suddenly some serious turbulence. Before you know it the plane is crashing. Lights go out. Alarms set off. Screams everywhere. The plane is nosediving into oblivion. You brace yourself for your imminent death. You pass out (only you didn’t; someone drugged you again). You wake up—miraculously you’re alive! The wreckage of the plane still burning nearby. You soon realize you’re the only survivor.

Not too far, you see a village. You walk towards it to seek help. Your adventure begins. Love, decadence, and glory await! 

You’re there for 3 days, 3 months, 3 years, or even till you die - depending on how much price was paid on your behalf, of course.

And then just when the good things seem to never end, you’re told the whole thing was a sham, and it’s time for you to leave the theme park.",hyggeguy,1626161835

7560,A brave new world part 3,"Hello, my name is Sylar De Luminous, and this is part 3 of a brave new world. I would like to discuss the new Inflation Tax system, Invisible Money, and reducing the cost of living. 

Part 1:  **tinyurl.com/4bwuh7e7** 

Part 2:  **tinyurl.com/3n4wu5zk** 

Neil DeGrasse Tyson mentioned in an interview that saying billionaires need to spend their money. I think that was a good idea, I also think taxing them more is a good idea too, but.. 

\#1 They really don't want to buy 150 Lamborghini each month

\#2 Entrepreneur don't spend money we all know that 

\#3 They have to own more shares than everyone (Company Control)

\#4 They don't actually have money to spend (Invisible Money)

\#5 All the money they earn that they can actually spend went to taxes already

\#6 We can't increase anymore taxes (See Part 2) 

&amp;#x200B;

Invisible Money Explain

Take a piece of paper, write Apple on it and rip it into 10 pieces. For the price of $1 a share, that put the company value at $10. When a new person want to invest and see value if those shares, he or she will then make an offer to buy a share. But nobody want to sell theirs at a $1, so this person have to offer more. This will increase value of the company because now each share are $2 each, putting the company value at $20. Once a while or every six months the company will split, this way to have more shares so more people can invest. So instead of having 1 share for $2 now you have 2 shares for $1 each. Rinse &amp; repeat this process until your company worth $2 trillions. Also when the company make profit and you're a investor, you get a little piece of that earning. If the company sold an iPhone for $1,000 and the profit margin are $283, you split that with a million other investor. If the company end up dead, your $200,000 worth of shares will turn to 0, same as the CEO with their billions. The money from dividend are profits and real money, until you retire and sell off your shares. Then someone else hold on to those Invisible Money.

This is how we generate money by generating values, like if an iPhone have no apps in it, nobody would want to buy it. So Apple allow companies to put apps and stuff on there for free so now everyone wants an iPhone. Same with Bitcoins or anything currency, just have Starbucks, Walmart, and all those big name chain stores to accept BTC, that will make BTC worth over 1 million each. Sound easy but then again. They know about trading and value more than any of us. The thing about currency trading is, if 1 go up 1 must go down. Put out 5 cups and pour water into each cup evenly then play around with it. What countries want is to have more water in their cup, meaning their currency has more value, meaning more buying power. This is why USD and EURO you can buy so many things with $100 in a third-world country, and why their currency are so cheap is because not all country accept it. Converting the currency back you probably lose some money.

&amp;#x200B;

Reducing the cost of living

Now, you have values and you have prices. How we come up with prices you can see (Part 1) for my horrible attempt at explaining it. Short way to explain prices is that's the cost to product it, then you meet with supply and demand. If demand is 50 iPhone per month and you can produce 50 iPhone per month, then it will be $1,000 each. If you can produce more than 50, price will drop $900 each, more sales same profit. If you can't produce 50, price will increase to $1,100, less sales same profit. And this is not mainly for profit purposes, but for balancing purposes, is to give out those limited gather resources to the highest bidder. You can't really be that much greedy about this, because the world only have enough money for that price. But for the prices to drop and keep the same profit is simple, through automation as much as possible, you know.. Have robots to gather resources and produce the products. Yes, we are losing jobs to robots and we are progressing quickly, that is actually a good thing(See part 1). By year 2035 we will lose 40% of labor jobs to AI. 

If you have heard of Universal Basic Income, lets start by jumping into building mega farm. We can use the early access of the funding to lower the cost of living, foods, water, electricity, rent. We can use these funding to build mega automated farm. We can dig down and have more than 5 layers, instead of building up to pump water, we can collect rain water and store it on the side next to the farm. Save energy pumping water, just let gravity do the rest. Now the big, big, big flat field we used to farm crops with, we can use them to farm more live stock, and you can already guess what we are using as roof for those barns. Now farmer not just farming rice, now they be farming everything, rice, animals and solar energy. 

Now for rent we got government housing. We can just copy China really with their 70 stories building, and since these are for low income, your cost of living each month will be less than $200. Like water is free, you are paying for the plastic and profit. Same with rice now, the price you pay is the price it cost to get to you. You can have drones delivery a bucket each month, or you drive there and get it yourself. Final option is catapult, we can launch a bucket of rice at your house but we are not responsible for property damages. 

These are better investment we should make, any other things beside these are luxury. From a scooter to an Xbox or a Lamborghini. We don't gather resources fast enough yet for everything else to be free, until we start asteroid mining, then other resources will be as cheap as water. That probably will happen in 2100 or 2150.",1925120118,1625969570

7584,"Answers to 42 (Hitchhiker’s Guide), 666 (beast), Tesla’s obsession with 3-6-9, and heck, Freemason’s 33! One cool book the Church doesn’t want you to know about","Hi everyone! So, I consider this my Part 2, where Part 1 was illustrating that the Bible, including the New Testament, misguides us. And I did that by referring to… Jesus himself! There’s a gospel (Gospel of Thomas) which has been thoroughly criticized by the church since early Christianity, and now I understand why. They were scared since it contains the true teaching of Jesus (I know it might sound silly, but hear me out!), which rips apart their whole orthodoxy. You can look at it if you want, but it’s pretty long, and I’d maybe make some edits to it if I were to post it again (but the overall message is there). Not only does it disprove the church orthodox and hierarchy (if my arguments make sense), but um… I found that the Book of Revelation might kind of forecasts the Gospel of Thomas as the second coming of Jesus. And wouldn’t you know it, that after being lost because the church buried the Gospel of Thomas since it was written in the first century, it naturally resurfaced in Egypt in December 1945. You know, 1 month after the apocalypse that was World War 2.

This is a bit of a long post, but I think it’s worth the read! Can't solve Tesla's obsession with a short post.

Anyways, now that we know that the Gospel of Thomas may contain the closest record of Jesus’s real words, I couldn’t help but explore a few things. Now first, 666, number of the beast. That is covered in my Part 1. Biblical numerology for 6 is us humans. We were made on Day 6 after all (Genesis). Beast, or the Lion referenced in Thomas 7, same thing. And we’ll continue to suffer and have periodical so called ‘Anti-Christs’ until we repent our old ‘beast’ ways and our old thoughts from the Old Testament. Jesus tried to teach us that we are spiritual beings, where our identity is a soul, and we are temporarily living in our fleshy animal bodies, which is our temple in this physical world. Jesus knew that he was a spirit and that his life in his physical human body was not the goal. He sacrificed his body (and experienced the physical pain with it, just as we would) to show us what he taught us, in the hopes of erasing our original sin… which is the mindset of the Old Testament. Since Adam and Eve, we were lost, we believe that we are not worthy of God, we believe he will punish us if we do wrong, we feel guilt and shame (about our bodies, and our actions), and we think we are weak and can’t do much without God intervening to save us. But no, Jesus says that we are spiritual beings, who, through the connection of the Holy Spirit (lots of talk on the Holy Spirit in Gospel of Thomas), we can truly connect with the Father. I personally like to think of our Holy Spirit as opening our 3rd eye. That’s the thing, we see Jesus’s crucifixion as ‘the ultimate sacrifice’, but that is where we are wrong. Also, there is no Hell.

Now moving onto 42. I couldn’t help but look up numbers and see what reading it was in the Gospel of Thomas. And wouldn’t you know it, Thomas 42 is the shortest of all 114 of them, and it summarizes Jesus’s advice to us for how we should live (and is also one of my favourites). Thomas 42 is:

* Jesus said, ""Be passersby.""

I’ve read the first 2 books of the Hitchhiker’s Guide series, and Thomas 42 made me think of Ford Prefect. His name is Ford Prefect because he had no name when he visited earth in the 1960’s, and he mistook a popular car, a Ford Prefect, as the earth’s dominant life form. This fits with Jesus’s message that overall, the details of our identity in the physical world don’t really matter, since we are spiritual beings; souls living in a fleshy animal. Doesn’t matter if it’s a human, or whatever the hell Zaphod Beeblebrox is, we are souls living in our temporary temple. And now the reason we want to be a passerby is that our soul is meant to learn from this existence. And what does Ford Prefect do? He’s an ‘alien’ journalist, a field researcher for the titular Guide itself. He is also referred to as Ix, or 9 in roman numerals. More on that later with Nikolai Tesla’s obsession with 3-6-9!

Ok, so by chance while browsing random YouTube videos I stumbled on 33 being the Freemason’s number. So of course, I checked out what Thomas had to say. Thomas 33 is:

* Jesus said, ""What you will hear in your ear, in the other ear proclaim from your rooftops.
* After all, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, nor does one put it in a hidden place. Rather, one puts it on a lampstand so that all who come and go will see its light.""

I’m not an expert, but did the founders of freemasons know the truth of the Gospel of Thomas? If you read through my Part 1, and if you do take the time to read the Gospel of Thomas, you might think that they did know. Plus, from the Wikipedia page:

* Freemasons, as speculative masons (meaning philosophical rather than actual building), use this symbolism to teach moral and ethical lessons, such as the four cardinal virtues of Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, and the principles of ""Brotherly Love, Relief (or Morality), and Truth""

Ok so I can’t help but think that some people throughout history, and perhaps even Douglas Adams knew of the truth contained in the Gospel of Thomas. But how can we tell for sure. Well… I urge you to read the Preface of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy written by Douglas Adams. He literally mentions Jesus! Here’s a part of it:

* And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
* This is not her story. But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences. It is also the story of a book, a book called ‘The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy’ not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
* Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.

Wow… I think he knew! It’s like a joke on how humanity will just find out about Jesus’s true teachings at the last second before the earth blows up.

Ok, so like I said above, Ford Prefect, the alien journalist for The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy itself, was also referred to as Ix, or 9. I also found out through random YouTube videos that Nikola Tesla was obsessed with numbers, but especially 3, 6 and 9. He’s quoted saying:

* “If you only knew the magnificence of 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe”

Unfortunately, he passed away in 1943, 3 years (minus a month) before the Gospel of Thomas resurfaced. He wanted the world to know the significance of the number 3 6 9, he claimed that these were extremely important numbers, but the question is why? Well, one part of it is that it follows the Golden Ratio (lots on google). But there’s also a strange and very interesting thing with 3-6-9 in numerology.

In numerology, they only use the numbers 1 through 9. And if you google “vortex math 369” you’ll see there’s some interesting things happening. In a way, the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 represent some sort of ‘**animal**’ numbers, since our animal cells always duplicate. So it goes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (7), 32 (5), 64 (10 = 1), 128 (1+2 =3, 3+8 = 11 = 2) and so on. It bounces along a root path of 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1, 2 and so on. So that leaves 3, 6 and 9 which can be considered the ‘**spiritual**’ numbers.

Now 3 and 6 have a relationship. If you double 3 (so 3, 6, 12, 24, etc.), you’re stuck between 3 and 6. And I’d recommend looking up 9, it’s a very significant number (I’m not an expert in this, just a problem solver connecting some dots).

So, as we know from 666, or just 6, it’s the number of us humans, our animal selves. And going back to the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus says essentially that it’s through our connection with the Holy Spirit that we’re connected to the spirit of the Father, or the creator. And well, honestly, I really see it as the same as our 3rd eye. And just in case, Jesus resurrected to the Spirit realm (if you will) 3 days after we crucified him, through the Holy Spirit. Is that also maybe why there are three 6's, we're sleeping beasts? So, I can’t help but wonder if this means that by us opening our 3rd eye, we can finally connect with who we are (spiritual beings, not our fleshy animal selves) and be connected with 9, the creator of all. And when we have just 2 eyes open, we bounce around in an infinite animal loop of numbers.

If you look at my Part 1, the thing is the Father, or creator does not do things directly. He just sort of is, he’s everywhere, he’s loving and caring, but he will not do things to us because we’re in his favour, and he won’t harm us since he never gets angry or vindictive towards us. But he’s probably not some crazy power-hungry god wanting to be worshiped like we’d imagine a human god (when thinking in beast terms). Maybe he’s like Ford Prefect! Always around Arthur Dent, saves him from the earth’s destruction, but at the same time it’s more situational. Arthur just happened to connect somehow, and he’s taken on a wild and crazy adventure. But Ford’s not always the smartest and often is just kind of there, doing his thing. And what does Jesus say of the Father? Thomas 97:

* Jesus said, ""The \[Father's\] kingdom is like a woman who was carrying a \[jar\] full of meal. While she was walking along \[a\] distant road, the handle of the jar broke and the meal spilled behind her \[along\] the road. She didn't know it; she hadn't noticed a problem. When she reached her house, she put the jar down and discovered that it was empty.""

This seems to explain that an action is symbolic of the creation of our physical universe. And at the same time, it wasn’t an intelligent design. The jar broke, meal spilled everywhere, and there you have it, our universe! And our animal human bodies came from billions of years of evolution following the first single cell organism that came from some sort of ‘primordial soup’.

While it might be a bit odd to think of our universe as some sort of metaphysical area, think of it this way. The observable universe is estimated to contain 200 billion to two trillion galaxies. And the entirety of our wildest fantasies, like Star Wars and Star Trek all occur within 1 single galaxy. Try imagining that. And to add to that, all of these galaxies are estimated to only account for 5% of the universe’s energy, where Dark Matter accounts for 27%, and Dark Energy accounts for 68%, and science can not explain those yet.

I just want to mention Adam and Eve again. First, again, since Adam and Eve, we were lost, we believe that we are not worthy of God, we believe he will punish us if we do wrong, we feel guilt and shame (about our bodies, and our actions), and we think we are weak and can’t do much without God intervening to save us. Now another fact of the whole ‘**apple incident**’ is that Adam became angry at both God and Eve. So, on top of connecting ourselves back to God by opening up our 3rd eye, we need to stop this nonsensical battle between men and women! Jesus through many saying in the Gospel of Thomas stresses the fact that souls don’t have genders. Our identity is not male or female. We are a spirit, and it just so happens that some souls’ temple is a female human body, and some is a male human body. I personally think that animals have a bit of a soul in them too, but their animal body’s brain does not have the capacity to think to the level needed to become enlightened sort of thing. And yes, this means that God loves the LGBTQ community and all races equally. His presence is always there and is always loving.

I’ll include something else from Part 1. What helped me to connect to the Holy Spirit and to really see myself as a soul in a fleshy animal body is this. Try pointing to yourself. Where are you pointing? I’d imagine either your heart or head (except for the odd joker pointing at their scrotum :p). Well, we know that we are made of animal cells, which in turn have subcellular components, and we can keep going all the way to atoms. But even atoms have sub-components with some space in-between which is essentially trapped energy. So, what is it that you are pointing at that is “You”? It’s sort of like opening a 3rd eye, where Adam and Eve only opened 2 eyes when they became conscious, but today, through Jesus, we can open our 3rd eye (I see as a way of understanding the Holy Spirit instead of a floating ball of fire).

I’ve seen Thomas 42’s “be passerby” described as all is transience, and all that you can collect on this earth will only weight you down on this journey through time. And like, I don’t know if it’s a coincidence that both 42, and the Freemason’s 33 both equate to 6 numerology wise. But there seems to be a lot of 3-6-9 going on. And if you look up universal frequencies (in terms of in Hz), I noticed 9, 6, 3 show up prominently. From google, I see 396 Hz as “liberates you from fear and guilt” (opening up 3rd eye can help with that), 639 Hz “reconnects you with your relationship” (we need to rediscover we are the ‘6’ in this, and it’s our animal selves), and 963 Hz “creates room for oneness and unity. Known as the Frequency of the Gods”. And I can’t help but like the order; 9-6-3, in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit?

&amp;#x200B;

OK folks. So as a somewhat creative person, I wanted to take a try at this idea of how 3-6-9 can help us and be this key to the universe that Tesla thought it was.

The first thing I want to suggest is that it has a very powerful practical application in our lives. Finding myself now having drunk Jesus’s ‘new wine’ from the Gospel of Thomas, suddenly I sort of feel like I really am a soul who’s temporary housed in the temple that is u/trebeck_x ‘s fleshy animal body. And what’s cool about it is that if I find myself drifting into any of Dante’s proposed nine levels of hell, I can snap out of it by reminding myself that it’s simply my animal self struggling with things that don’t really matter on this sometimes-chaotic earth. It really puts things into perspective. I should not stress or worry about that lost soul living in my ex’s fleshy animal body.

The opposite end of the spectrum (in this example) are some people who place so much priority on earthly things, and it drives them out of control. Like totally ‘losing it’ on a kid for accidentally scratching a wall or breaking something. Does that matter in the grand scheme of things that the wall got scratched, or something got broken on accident, by a child? And today we know that a lot of kids suffer childhood trauma for things like that, which can have negative impacts on their life as an adult. It seems the way the childhood trauma manifests itself in their day to day lives could result in them traumatizing a subsequent child, and it’s like an infectious energy traveling down generations until some of them get out of the cycle by fixing themselves and making sure they don’t pass it down to their own kids.

So, in that example, I think it clearly shows a very powerful impact of us collectively trying to open that stubborn 3rd eye of ours, so we can both overcome our personal issues (by trying to not let earthly things impact us too much). And it may also help us become kinder to each-other. Again, let’s stop this fighting between men and women (we’re all genderless souls deep down inside), but I think this would also help us be kinder towards others. If we see people acting out negatively, we won’t take it personally since we recognize they’re a ‘lost soul’ and isn’t seeing life through their 3rd eye.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, people, so we’re talking Tesla here. Nikola ‘**freakin genius**’ Tesla, claiming “If you only knew the magnificence of 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe”. WTF could he have been imagining making this claim?

Well, I’m finding I’m quite creative, so my mind did go in a direction. This is kind of weird and sort-of science fiction-y. So like, I’m not saying this is ‘the’ answer. It’s just some weird idea that popped in my head and I figure I’d write it out.

As per Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas (whether they are Jesus’s actual spoken words or not, but I believe they are), there are 2 things that can happen when we die.

If our soul does not get the awakening it needs to ‘pass the test’ and get into this heaven/spirit realm after their fleshy animal body dies, their soul, having been lost, ends up back in the void it once came from. It undergoes a ‘hard reset’, so not quite reincarnation. But part of that life-giving goopy soul energy will get another chance.

Our soul found its way during its time in the physical realm, and it gets to join God/Creator/Father in Heaven. The spirit is reborn as a baby in heaven though, so it does not hold any of your animal life identity. I know that might not sound the best, but I trust that having that opportunity, whatever it may be, is infinitely worth it.

So, if we truly understand and believe that this is the reality of our existence, then maybe we’ll humble ourselves and realize we truly are all working together. We all share the commonality of having some soul goop inside of us, and the purpose is to make sure it attains enough knowledge (that I have no clue what it is in term of what makes you a Spirit) to make it to the other side, instead of falling back in the void it came from. I think that would revolutionize our thinking. And in a way, we can create an infinite amount of work together… And, like this is not at all a ‘hive mind’ sort of thing, because the reality is that every single human being body is different. We all have small differences in our brain and overall biology it seems, where we have different personality traits (like psychology). If anything, I think the idea is that we can collectively work together to create some sort of Garden of Eden for ourselves. Technology and automation will probably be out of control a few centuries from now, so if we can all work together, we can build a world where all humans born are given the same opportunities to journey through our world (and universe really). But that there are many different options which can suit the huge diversity of ways we may want to travel through our temporary existence in this physical world.

Now see, there is still a ‘faith’ part in this; it’s still a bit of a mystery. Unless science can fully discover what the heck all this dark matter and dark energy is, we will never know if the direction humanity is going is increasing the common productivity of getting our uninformed souls to find the way to the spirit realm after death. But, if we all believe in it, we can expand life all over to create all sorts of opportunities to ensure that some souls make it. And heck, the thing is that if we humble ourselves and keep planting trees instead of being selfish and wish that someone else planted one 20 years ago, think of the forest (or garden) we can build. And with this new discovery of our existence, we can stop thinking in such small time frames, like how ‘quarterly results’ dictate how corporations make decisions, which then impacts all us humans (and it’s getting worse in terms of their influence). With this new discovery of our existence, where we are humble and know that if our soul doesn’t make it in this lifetime (and that’s OK, maybe next time), we should start thinking in larger time frames to make smarter decisions. Our soul goop likely works under geological time as a frame of reference.

I have no clue what it means when we transition the uninformed soul goop to the spirit realm (heaven). But this made me think of that somewhat popular “The Egg – A Short Story” video on YouTube. Idk…

I just want to end with a few more notes (I can never stop writing lol). I don’t know for sure, but I can’t help but think that animals and maybe even plants and insects do have this life-giving soul goop within them as well. The main difference is that their bodies do not contain the anatomy necessary to learn through knowledge of our enlightened being. It’s like we went from animals to conscious, and now through the second coming of Jesus (I know…) we can take the next step and open up our 3rd eye. And as said in Genesis, the Garden of Eden is a paradise where we live in harmony with nature.

Another thing I noticed is how poisonous our selfish thinking is. We have always been so fascinated and sometimes obsessed with this idea of being able to travel back in time. And it really is just for selfish reasons; to improve our comfort somehow during our temporary journey in the physical world. However, the more data we collect of the cosmos, we can then literally predict the future! All the galaxies are in motion, and unless conscious (but hopefully enlightened) people nudge things in different directions (like deflecting an asteroid), the wheels are already in motion, and the universe can’t do anything but follow the laws of the universe. Let’s point our eyes to the future, while standing in the present, and leave the past in the past, only looking at it for wisdom through lessons learned.

And last point. I don’t think we can ever create a spaceship that is as functional, comfortable, and pleasurable as a planet. There is no way we can produce, or ever strive to live solely in a spaceship. We need to maintain this beautiful planet we call earth, but technology is reaching a point where we can begin thinking about colonizing, and even terraforming other planets. How cool would it be to have many gardens like Eden, and a means for each soul being able to experience whatever they want during their limited time in this physical realm.

Anyways… at the end of the day, I don’t think we’re meant to be self-centered beings. But our heads are so deeply consumed by these earthly temptations that it makes it difficult. But Jesus survived 40 days in the desert, and so can we.

Take care everyone! (speaking to your inner souls)",trebeck_x,1625923073

7622,"""Camilion branding"" a restaurant chain that has no brand of its own but adopts the local known ""homey"" joint brand(legally), then drives prices down to bankrupt the original, then completely absorb any asset the original had for profit.","Here how it's work in my head.

Step -1#: a scout goes thru an area looking for a cute place to hang out in casually interviews the locals for places with a nice atmosphere.

step 0#: said scout evaluates target store for certain characteristics:

\-one or more staple products that

* have local recognisability with the positive sentiment (""Papa Alex chilli fries are a fucking legend"")
* easy to reproduce with cheaper alternatives or existing within the chain production process(frozen fries instead of fresh, chilli from a can etc'...)

\-character worker who has a personal relationship with the community. To be targeted as an asset for the ""acquisition"" step later primarily if he is irreplaceable for the brand feel. If one of the targeted workers is the owner himself or family favour the ""buy and squeeze"" option later

\-identify successful key brand schematics if there are, colour logo plating decor... then inquire whatever they filled a trademark claim. \[if not rush the steps to the opening step and recommend filling for trademark ASAP. If a trademark is in place go for the borderline copy even if the originals will file a claim for TM infringement the chain will stand to lose much less than the owner as legal procedures are more expensive for small businesses.\]

\-identify buyable location near the original for the ""compete and squeeze"" option later

\-inquire for owner business model as to exploit flaws that will improve leverage during the ""buy and squeeze"" option later, which includes overpaid staff, quality products with alternatives, underpriced bonus food and drinks (free refills, employe that give a couple of fries for free with a wink).

\-find out if the owners have savings it will make easier to predict how long the original will survive if competed against

\-finally, recommend for the opening team the scouts insight on whether to ""compete and squeeze"" or ""buy and squeeze"".

If chosen option failed the default option of ""compete and sabotage "" will be enacted.

step 1#:

* If B&amp;S chosen.
   *  evaluate primary acquiring costs
   * approach owners with an extremely undervalued offer for the place; if accepted(unlikely) stonks
   * if not, it's still part of the plan. come with a new offer this time with the owner and targeted workers as managers or elevated shift managers while keeping their salaries and promise to keep the brand of the place without change. \*\*with some legal loophole allowing for cuts\*\*, barter for at least \~70% ownership buy to ensure the changes to come.
   * start to implement the cutting steps made by the scout and planning team replace products, cut salaries etc'
   * squeeze the owners. Keep, give raise, and promote targeted employees so he won't leave after we basically destroyed his home from the inside.
* If C&amp;S chosen
   * amazon the original till he cries Jeff's jizz, use mentioned capital evaluation to accurately predict when the bankruptcy begins.
   * replicate products and brand as planned
   * initial boost to wages and lower prices of dishes at a loss that a large chain can afford, unlike the local business who most likely has a small margin of profit and small capital liquidity ;););)
   * send scouts for signs of defeat, disgruntled owner, unclean tables food quality goes down. Accelerate steps to ensure there is no ""brand kamikaze""
   * privately send tempting offers for targeted employees 
   * Slap suit the owner just to rub it in if the trademark case was successful.
   * after bankruptcy raise prices again do the cutting steps mentioned above.

step 2# and final:

formalise a business plan test it for a few months then show promising sell the venture to a new franchised model and bounce the scout to a new location.

""compete and sabotage"" is exactly what it sounds like. Go wild if casual competition does not work. Property is mostly insured so the personal angel is best, ~~owners are likely to be friends or family so threats can be very effective. it's hard to do a cutthroat competition with oil efficient restaurant chain when literal cutthroat tactics are a possibility so the owners will most likely give up.~~",Thevoidawaits_u,1625833352

Spoilers might be ahead!,"Today while I was at work at one of my local pizza shops, I thought about Toy Story 2, which I had watched on the Fourth just a few days prior to today. I remembered as a kid, seeing the spin-off show based off Buzz Lightyear (Buzz Lightyear of Star Command) and thought about Woody’s ‘show within a show’ in 2, Woody’s Roundup. I would like to see a spin-off or a ‘based on’ animated series using material from the movies and see a real ‘Woody’s Roundup’ show like the one shown in 2.

Judging by the sheer volume and variety of merchandise Al had collected over the years in 2, it is clear that in the franchise’s universe, this show was a big hit and possibly a long running show. I imagine the videotape that the toys in Al’s apartment watch is not the only tape of the show that Al has in his collection of memorabilia.

Also, since we never hear the recorded catchphrases of the other toys in the Roundup Gang, what would their lines be? I am curious to know what the toy personas of Jesse and Stinkey Pete have to say.

Another thing to note is Woody’s catchphrase ‘Somebody’s poisoned the water hole!’ That line is never spoken in any of the material shown in the tape that we see, so, how many other episodes of the show were on that tape, and what other plots were thought up in the process of making those plot points in 2, that were scrapped? What else could be revealed about Roundup using this information?

None of the cast members we see in Roundup are portrayed as antagonists, so who else is on the show that could be the one who ‘poisoned the waterhole’, if that line is indeed from another episode we never got to see? In addition, Woody’s line in 3, ‘I’d like to join your passé, boys, but first I’m going to sing a little song’ is completely different from the closing theme of Roundup that we see in 2, where Woody’s puppet sings ‘you’ve got a friend in me’ and the little boy hugs the puppet. What other songs had Woody sang in his show, and could these songs be the reason for why a record player with the theme music was added to the line of merchandise? Was Roundup a TV show like ‘The Muppets’ where cast members and the audience could interact regularly?

I’m also curious about how Woody was able to come to terms with being a toy and not his character like in his show, like how Buzz had to be convinced he wasn’t a real space ranger, and found out the hard way he couldn’t actually fly. Did Hamm believe he was a real pig for a time? How much time had passed from when Andy got Woody to the time Buzz arrived?

Back to Roundup. The movies show us that the toys’ personalities can be influenced by outside events, like how Lotso became bitter because of his belief that Daisy had replaced him, and how Stinkey Pete had gotten his villainous outlook on life from his time in the ‘dime store shelf’ feeling unappreciated since the other toys were being sold instead of him. What was Stinkey Pete like before his villainous side was brought up from this experience? Was he able to talk to the other toys in the store he was in, and was he in character from Roundup? I imagine it must have been several years before Al found Stinkey Pete, enough time for him to completely abandon his TV persona and become the villain of 2.

Another one of Woody’s catchphrases is ‘this town ain’t big enough for the two of us!’ That phrase is usually a stock line used in parodies of Western shows, but if that was a quote from Roundup, I wonder what story events took place for Woody to say that. Additionally, what could the name of the town be that Roundup takes place in, and how many seasons could it have had?

If I think of any other details off of the movies that I missed, that would possibly be clues to learn more about this fictional TV series, I will put the details in the comments below. What do you guys think of my observations about this fictitious show that you would like to see fleshed out in a real version of this series?

One more note, it would be a great idea to have the real show be animated in the same style as the material shown on the tape in 2, or at least a very close matching art style. That would make the most sense.

7674,Shape changing breast implants for systems or genderfluid people,"This sounds fucking ridiculous but just hear me out

Ok. So. I'm part of an osdd 1b system of 10. Osdd means other specified dissociative disorder. Basically, there's 10 people in our head and we switch who's in control.

We have a problem that we've been thinking about. Not everyone is the same gender. We're amab we have a male body, but there are male, female, and non binary people in here and we all want our body to look differently.

A girl in our system has gender dysphoria regarding our chest. She wants breasts, but the only way to get that is either surgery or hormones, which we are NOT doing because you can't comfortably wear a binder with an implant and hormones have unwanted affects.

I'll cut to the chase. I want a synthetic skin covering our chest. Under that I want something that can expand or retract, so we can choose how we want to look as different people are in control of the body.

I've done very minimal research and here's my idea so far.

On the outside you have some kind of synthetic skin like Integra (a skin substitute for like healing wounds and stuff), then some more silicone under that, and then I've thought of a few options for the shape changing mechanism.

You could use nitinol or similar shape memory materials or you could inflate or deflate a it like a kind of balloon with liquid and have an external part to fill it or take out the liquid.

It has to be synthetic skin because skin isn't supposed to stretch and contract like that and I want this to be able to be used a lot. We switch multiple times a day.

I know this sounds really weird but.. every genderfluid person/system wishes they could be a shapeshifter. It hurts when you have dysphoria and you know that you can't ever fix it completely. So I want to fix it.

We're already working on the obvious stuff. Voice training, slowly getting clothes everyone is happy in, we grew our hair to the length we're all comfortable with.

Anyway what else. Idk. Just tell me what you think I guess",thapenguino,1625712738

7679,"If the solution to a problem is easy to verify for correctness, must the problem be easy to solve? (&lt;--google this phrase)"," 

when a solution to a problem appears, it is easy to verify that solution solves the problem, or you would have another problem and not a solution, no?

Consider the below problem

1. Pick a coin choose a side and flip it as freely as you want to live.
2. After you can guess the side the coin ends up facing you right all the time and regardless of the time and space you live, I have a question for you.
3. Why didn't you come here now to tell me about it stop writing before I finish this question here?

The above is a problem whose solution is easy to verify for correctness, but the problem isn't easy to solve, no?

Because if any problem was easy to solve, someone could predict the future, but next doesn't happen next in imagination really, next happens next in reality.

Another way to explain...

1.You are asking, if the solution to a problem is easy to check for

correctness, must the problem be easy to solve?

2. When a solution for the problem appears it is easy to check that

this solution solves the problem, or else you would have

another problem, and not really a solution.

3. A problem needs to start a path in time and space which ends

with a solution for this problem, in order for the problem to be

solved in time and space, or else all paths in time and space

with a beginning, a middle, and an end wouldn’t solve this

problem.

4. if it is easy to solve…

5. it is easy to check that the solutions solve the problem, or you’d

have more problems,

6. or you didn’t find this path… … so pick a coin, choose a side, and flip it as freely as you want

to live.

7. After you can guess the side the coin ends up facing you right all

the time, I have a question for you.

Like when I use a bandaid, a bandaid appears on the counter the next time I come to the kitchen. I left the house and my little brother sits there and when I come back he's still there so I go up to my room. I went down again and he's gone. He left the house but the trash can is moved. I know know well that things move around the house but the things that are moved is like my siblings is messing with me. Someone goes in my room and puts medals on my desk. There were 3 medals, 2 of my brother, and 1 is mine. 1 of the medal belonged to the one who I think put it on my desk. I confronted him and he said it wasn't him. He kept saying he doesn't care about me, etc. But he has his own bathroom and keeps using the bathroom on my floor and moves things in there too. 

Isn't this a tactic to make people crazy? 

I was going crazy and kept asking my parents. My parents has very low level of education so they don't know these things. I got in a fight so much with my mom cause I kept accusing her and she doesn't believe her son would do such thing. She doesn't think he's capable of lying. 

Why would they want to mess with me?  I was in college trying to study to get my degree for my future and it's competitive. 1 of my siblings didn't go straight to college and the other didn't do well. I was so focused and I have this huge feeling it's them.

THIS is the way to do it right!","First, there aren't enough billionaires, so you'll have to settle for multi-millionaires. They can't be nouveau-riche -- *old money only*. Self-made, ""new money"" millionaires will remember how they survived on very little money and have an unfair advantage.

The show would be called ""**From Old Money to No Money**."" And it would basically star the children of the super-wealthy (*cough*Kardashians*cough*). They wouldn't be playing for a cash reward either, but for charitable donations. The winner(s) get $1 million (or $500,000, or whatever the network can afford) donated to the charity of their choice.

Contestants have to survive on minimum wage (at least from the beginning) for 5 months (about 20 weekly episodes). They can't bring ANYTHING from their lives with them. No phone, no credit cards, no cash, no car... nothing. 

They can bring a handful of clothes/outfits, a computer, a few pieces of furniture, a TV (all of which they may have to pawn later in the season), *essential* toiletries, and... Hell, let's let 'em bring a pet, shall we? They'll also be provided with one week's worth of food. 

They can live on the streets, or ""borrow"" money (at an exorbitant interest rate) for first month + security deposit on a shit apartment. They can get ""assistance"" (provided through the network, but designed to be as convoluted and complicated as real-world assistance programs).

And they are assigned a random minimum wage job at the beginning of the show. They can quit and get a new job and they can accept raises/promotions/better positions, but they can't include any real life credentials on their resumés, other than the job(s) they work during the show. 

If they give up, they lose and forfeit the donation to their choice charity (probably meaning that they'd have to match the donation to buy themselves out of public ridicule).

If they get fired and don't get a new job within a week, they lose. If they can't pay their bills, they lose. If they get caught cheating, they lose. If they get budgeting advice from a financial expert they would normally have to pay (like their real life advisors, for example, or someone they promise to pay later), they lose.

I've considered maybe even including a ""student loan"" option, where they can upgrade to a better, entry-level professional job... but then they have to pay the student loan payments for the rest of the game.

""Spend $1 to win?"" Damn rite you will! Your card is charged an additional $1 for the random chance to win a cash prize (credited to your card/account) or a 10$ discount on your next order.

Now friends, it's not as crazy as it sounds. I've thought this through. I probably should have patented the idea because I reckon I'm onto a winner here (literally!)

The amount to ""play"" and the prize is determined by the store. It's fully optional and you are under no obligation to play. Shopping just got a lot more exciting! But there will need to be some restrictions for those who cannot excercise self control. The opportunities to play are limited to once per shop per day. This prevents a backlog of eager players purchasing randomly and spending their money for the chance to win.

Can you imagine a Friends spin-off set nowadays? If in the original series the characters where in their 20s/30s, nowadays they'd be in their late 40s/50s. And instead of being the cool young people they originally were, the aged characters would be typical Karens (if you see their behaviour in the original series, you will notice they were doomed to that).

In addition to the episodes pitched on the title, there could be ""The one where Ross blames Susan for their kid coming out"", or ""The one where Chandler is prosecuted for transphobia"". It would still be a comedy series, and we would laugh at the inappropriateness of the friends' behaviour.

The exponential gains  from this method and model ought to be usable in a different application such as in the realm of Climate Change.

The idea is rough at best so, sorry for that upfront. The idea is simple though. One large solar array couldn't compete with billions of small scale solar stations. Say I can buy a unit for $100 bucks, let it run and collect energy and send it to a mainframe, just imagine how much energy is gathered when billions are doing it too.",asasas111,1625327905

Just going through small flat objects with hands. When data storage devices had much less capacity and had larger physical size, there was more label reading. Now attaching cardboard card to usb-stick takes some improvisation and there is no obvious one way for it.

Some kind of physical index of some content in a 2000 GB hard drive could be in pieces of paper or cardboard, if someone wants that. Then have to type the file path or keyword, or in theory show a QR-code to camera.

I literally don't know if physical search can ever be better than keyword or browsing in software. Maybe it is matter of taste in those cases?",herkato5,1625310055

Video game creators should create more video games that interact with the outside world the way Pokémon go did to get more people moving. I would love to see adventure like Mario or puzzle games that somehow interact with the map or Something like an RPG with a storyline example - oh no the masked bad guy just ran off with your Jewels - His hidden liar has been found and is located on the map (have it within walking distance. Enemies would be chilling o. The screen and start walking towards you if you got close enough (but have the enemies never go into the road for safety purposes. There could other things for you to explore on your phone screen. Coins you could get close enough to and collect to buy things. Hidden items in boxes or bushes super emposed like the Pokémon were. You get close enough and click to open. ect.    Even a simple scavenger hunt for items within a certain area would work,                                               Characters to talk to or side quests. It would take some major crazy work to make sure it was safe - or you could mark on the map the locations that are accessible to you then the game could be loaded to fit that area - like circling a public park with a wand or wherever marking out private property as a user.

7884,Fully Convertible Flying Car Completes First Airport Flight," 

It was once the stuff of science fiction novels, but the concept of a flying car is now a reality after a prototype completed a 35-minute flight between two airports in Slovakia. The AirCar is capable of flying around 600 miles at a height of up to 8,000ft. An ingenious cross between a car and an aircraft, it runs on normal petrol-pump fuel and is powered by an engine made by BMW, with a cruising speed of 120mph. The flying car made a successful flight between the airports of Nitra and Bratislava in Slovakia on Monday. After landing at Bratislava airport, its inventor, Prof Stefan Klein, drove it straight from the runway into the city. To transform from a car into an airplane takes less than three minutes. Its wings rise up and then fold along the sides of the vehicle. So far the AirCar, which can carry two people, has completed around 40 hours of test flights but it is not yet certified for commercial flight.

The post is about having one bathroom door with a picture of a fish and one with a picture of a sandal and seeing which one people choose to use.

The idea could be expanded into a game of sorts, like word association. You would pick two completely unrelated things and ask someone to categorize them based on gender.

Examples that could be used are:
- Cloud and tea cozy
- Panini and step stool 
- Syringe and catapult 
- Kangaroo and printing press 
- Textbook and soda can 
- The Suez Crisis and the Dreyfuss Affair

This game could be used as a way to get to know someone better; it would illuminate what they see as ""masculine"" or ""feminine.""

2. Supply chain changes are implemented, reducing plastic usage, increasing biodegradable materials. 

3. Nothing happens and we burn the world down quicker.

7899,"Begone sad joker...wait, what?!.","  Here, we keep it short and simple...where we can, cause…we ain’t gonna end with all those sad jokers!

**“Who are the sad jokers”**, and why all this fuss someone wonders?

*Those who use their will to spread their sadness are sad jokers…*

*…cause they take the mind of others of all the joy…*

*…that something else than sadness comes…*

&amp;#x200B;

**“What?!”**, someone may think here.

* What I believe is that:

*There are people throughout the history of humans…*

* And I understand it as:

*very frequently male in gender, but fewer times also women, who use their will to spread their sadness…*

* And why I have to say that is as:

*this is what I read in the history people wrote down over, and over, and…over…*

* And how I think about it, is that this happens:

*because they believe that when they are sad, other people have to be sad as well, for them to feel better… but…*

* But this behavior doesn’t make sense to me because:

*this isn’t what seems to be happening sad jokers!., as you don’t imagine stuff and stuff happens, stuff is happening, and you can imagine how that is.*

* And in case one wonders:

*“So how can one imagine how stuff seems to be happening?”*

* And what I am afraid I have to say to the sad jokers is that:

*if you are sad, what is happening to you, doesn’t necessarily happen to others, or you are imagining stuff…and expect them to happen…but…*

* And.. in the end:

*if you want to have fun, you need patience to allow your body to feel fun, and you need to be careful as some-times…it is more fun than what you can handle at that moment in your life…*

&amp;#x200B;

**“Well yeah, but sometimes it is less fun than I want, at that moment in my life!”**, someone shouts back here…

That is also true, but…

*1.When you are having a good time, it is just the right amount of fun…*

*2.And to find those times, I am afraid we come back to the beginning…*

*3.You need patience to have fun.*

&amp;#x200B;

**“No, No, No, you shall not write such stuff here!”**, someone shouts back here angrily…

So… what if someone doesn’t understand and gets angry?.. I wonder, and I write back…

*After one gets angry, some time has to pass for that one to relax, because if you REALLY think otherwise…*

*After one gets angry, some time doesn’t have to pass for that one to relax, but if you think this is REALLY ok for you…*

*If in the end, after one gets angry, some time doesn’t have to pass for that one to relax, it doesn’t seem to me that one isn’t constantly angry…does it seem to you…idiot?*

&amp;#x200B;

**“How dare you insult me, do you know who I am?”**

Not really…

&amp;#x200B;

**“I am POWERFUL, I am HOLLY, and I am WISE, and you can write nothing back here!”**

Not really, here’s something for each of you…

* Here’s something to all the “POWERFUL” ones

*1.Powerful people are good at having others believe they are powerful. If others stop believing that, then pow-erful people become less powerful …quite quickly…*

*2.If powerful people lose all their powers…then…they don’t have any powers, and can’t have fun. When some-thing else is happening, and others start forgetting how powerful, powerful people are, then…powerful people quickly try to remind them before everyone forgets…cause it goes back to 1…*

*3.Because of this, what is no one’s problem in society…becomes everyone’s problem in society. Why? Because some Jokers are sad and this is funny. Why? Cause others aren’t and they are useful to society.*

*And who am I?*

*I am no one I don’t know who the hell you think you are! Why?*

*Cause, you ain’t someone, and you ain’t fooling no one buddy!*

* And here’s something to all the “HOLLY” ones

*1. Holly people are the ones who are good by default (good by default= as a given). Because they are good by default, if they say or do something, it can’t be bad. Because they can’t be bad, anything they say or do is fun in the end…*

*2. And…as anything they say or do is fun in the end, and people want to have fun, the holly people end up saying what happens next…cause it goes back to 1…*

*3. And…because what happens next, happens…well…next regardless…what is no one’s problem in society, be-comes everyone’s problem in society. Why? Because some jokers are sad and this is funny. Why? Cause others aren’t and they are useful to society.*

*And who am I?*

*I am no one I don’t know who the hell you think you are! Why?*

*Cause, you ain’t someone, and you ain’t fooling no one buddy!*

* And here’s something to all the “WISE” ones

*1.Sad Jokers spend time and effort to trade with others (trade=I do this for you, you do that for me, for what-ever this and that is for the specific occasion and instance with the other you are trading with) , but they are not having fun. Because others spend time and effort to trade with others, plus have fun doing this , Sad Jokers need to become good at something else to make money. So they spend their time and effort on something else, on which they become efficient…*

*2.Because they become good at something else, their actions are not reducing the time and effort spend to trade, as… they spend their time and effort on something else. So, the money they make, is more efficient in reducing the time and effort spend on trading, than they are, and…the more money they make…the more time and effort needs to be spend on trading in society, and money in the end becomes inefficient for society…cause…you know what…back to 1…*

*3. Because of this, what is no one’s problem in society…becomes everyone’s problem in society. Why? Because some Jokers are sad and this is funny. Why? Cause others aren’t and they are useful to society. How? By saying what money does…what’s that? Money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another, this is what money does, and don't waste my time and effort any further...*

&amp;#x200B;

*Because in the end all you powerful, all you holly, and all you wise ones…*

*I don’t know what paradise you imagine…*

*…but from that paradise that you imagine, can you imagine this place here now where you imagined it from?..*

*…what does that mean? It means I don’t know what paradise you imagine, but in real paradise…even the devil is having fun…or you forgot someone, but God REALLY didn’t forget something to do, if God REALLY did every-thing…*

*…but be careful…cause the devil has a mother…but also don’t worry…MAMA in the end puts order.*

*…and who is MAMA you wonder…MAMA is the rest…what is the rest?.. the rest is all there is minus you…*

*…and who am I? I am no one I don’t know who the hell you think you are! Why?*

*…cause, you ain’t someone, and you ain’t fooling no one buddy!*

&amp;#x200B;

**P.s. “NO, NO, NO, I am a sad joker and want to read more, as I think I know what is really fun!”**

**“Now, you writing down all these stuff here no one, wait a minute…how can you…no one…write that God REALLY didn’t forget something to do, if God REALLY did everything?.. who are YOU to write that down?!.”**

When one writes something down for the same God as the ones before one

*When one writes something down for the same God as the ones before one, the ones before one did not write it down EXACTLY as the same God would want it to be written down, because if you REALLY think otherwise…*

*When one writes something down for the same God as the ones before one, the ones before one wrote it down EXACTLY as the same God would want it to be written down, but if you think this is REALLY ok for you…*

*If in the end, when one writes something down for the same God as the ones before one, and the ones before one wrote it down EXACTLY as the same God would want it to be written down, it doesn’t seem to me that...*

*GOD REALLY DIDN’T FORGET SOMETHING TO DO,*

*IF GOD REALLY DID EVERYTHING*

*...for the next ones who would like to write something down for the same God…does it seem to you…idiot?*

*And remember…idiot…*

*I am no one I don’t know who the hell you think you are! Why?*

*Cause, you ain’t someone, and you ain’t fooling no one buddy!*

When something you imagine is really funny…well then…it has to REALLY be funny…and…

When something you imagine isn’t funny…well then…it REALLY isn’t worth our time and effort spend talking about it, unless we have to of course…

7945,Why low-code is the next big thing?,"With application development technologies rapidly advancing, and the need for digitization still more, primitive custom coding techniques have become increasingly obsolete for newer businesses. And with the influx of artificial intelligence, digital disruption is going to lay the groundwork for emerging digital technologies and business models. Modern low-code development technologies are key to keep up with the withering rate of change.

With so many programming applications readily available to countless new businesses, it brings into question how business applications will advance, and whether low-code is the next big thing in application development.

By emphasizing the visual aspect of designing an application, low-code eliminates the need for professional programming expertise. Low-code development platforms standardize the application development process by offering drag-and-drop interfaces with prebuilt “building blocks” that require minimal custom coding. This gives new business users and non-developers the opportunity to get involved in digital innovation. By allowing businesses to mediate the development of workflow applications, low-code speeds up the turnaround and bridges the long-standing gap between business and IT.

Low-code permits quick delivery of business applications, which can be vital to competitive differentiation.

Traditional development platforms require teams of professional developers banging in complex codes for countless hours, without leaving any room for organizations to take a hand in the digital transformation. Custom coding calls for long app development cycles. These custom codes are inflexible due to their complexity and making any changes is challenging and costly. This makes it hard for businesses to keep up with app demands and decelerates mobility across operating systems.

This is no longer a viable option if one wishes to operate at digital speed. Low-code development streamlines app architecture, creating viable solutions across operating systems. Adopting low-code platforms that permit business users to design and test great ideas with stakeholders can revolutionize application development for organizations, and do so expeditiously.

The pandemic has revealed just how hands-on many large enterprises actually are. With coronavirus numbers still soaring, digital transformation is no longer just a buzzword, but a crucial factor for the fate of a business. Low-code was already gaining traction, and the pandemic has accelerated the technology’s growth into the mainstream. Low-code has emerged as a useful technology to address immediate concerns of customers and digitalizing operations for workers.

8035,In my opinion God only hates Male masturbation. Female masturbation is biblically OK,"So I found in doing research for my podcast that strictly speaking the Bible doesn’t say anything about female masturbation or the female orgasm. Now it is unquestionable that according to the Bible God does not want men to waist there seed therefore you make masturbation is always a sin (unless you edge yourself maybe). Female orgasms has no set role in procreation even if some argue that it can aid. If it were a sin it would explicitly be mentioned in the Bible. The female orgasm is not a recent invention or discovery so if it were apart of divine judgment I don’t see why the authors would neglect it. 

In my research I’ve heard some women account that female masturbation is sinful because it’s a product of lust. However, I’ve heard asexual women describe masturbation as an activity to release stress with no lustful targets at all. Some women are easily set off by items like the washer and describe a need to finish what’s been started if it happens, once again with seemingly no lustful target though that one can be disputed. So if female masturbation is preformed with a lustful target in mind then I concede that might be a sin by biblical standards but using the strict TEXT of God I think it can be argued that female masturbation and orgasms aren’t even inherently sexual. It’s merely a tool for women to find relief which occasionally may happen during sex as it just so happens to involve the sexual organ. 

I say argue again that surely god and his chosen authors would have mentioned the wrongfulness of something as normal and common as the female orgasm if it were relevant given that it explicitly talks about the wrongness of a wasted male orgasm. I mean sure there are other important things that would have been nice for god to mention like how there are 7 continents on Earth, that we revolve around the sun, or even that their are other planets circling those things we call stars but I refuse to believe he just never got around to telling humanity female masturbation was a bad thing. 

For the record this is my interpretation of the Bible not my actual views on the female orgasm. I’m trying to challenge my friends so arguments are welcome.",KinkyCaptionCrafter,1624860894

+ Allow customers to submit ticket claims through your insurance. Ex: On your dash cam, you catch someone running a red light. You can report this through your insurance, the insurance company then handles the report to local authorities, and your insurance company will pay you for successful claims.

If people could have their expenses (food, rent, healthcare) paid for while they were attending community college, it would essentially be a type of social safety net, but one that brings a benefit to society.

With the pressure off, people could keep trying new career paths as long as they needed to, in order to find something fulfilling, and something they were good at. If it wasn't working, no pressure, just go back to school.

Even people who didn't ultimately find a good match would still be productive members of society, and the main cause of crime (poverty) would be greatly reduced. People could be perpetual students, if nothing else.

Fire hydrants still exist.

One Uber-style fire truck that picks up anyone who signed up to be a firefighter that is 'available' when a call comes in. Driver has the latitude to decide when he's picked up enough folks to respond to the call. Fire truck may also double as a booze party truck / ice cream truck / kids birthday party truck when not busy.

Some basic test to qualify one as an available firefighter, such as fitting inside a fire truck and climbing up a flight of stairs or putting out a charcoal grill fire. Maybe checking for a pulse or hooking up a garden hose to a spicket. Set the bar low, but not too low.

Slightly reduced taxes for all residents.

Fire truck is allowed to get sponsored by various businesses. (Pull over honey, here comes Panda Express 3 Entree down the road)

Fire truck has standard sirens, lights, but also a megaphone where they can yell at drivers. Possibly plays Mario Kart sound effects.

It is mostly made of PCB material. Part of the mask forms a medical monitor that measures the vital signs of the wearer. The pumps dispense appropriate drugs and neurotransmitters that are absorbed through the skin. You can imagine the mask like a chemical exoskeleton. I got the idea for this when I read a newspaper article years ago about a child who was trapped under a car and the mother lifted the car without help to free her child due to the adrenaline rush. And let's face it, most superheroes until now only wore masks to remain anonymous and not to get superpowers.

The mask is not yet complete, but I have made progress with the SMT (Surface Mounted Technology) micro piezo pumps.

Drawbacks:

1. the Court will initially get bigger.  But eventually a steady-state would be reached where justices would be aging out at roughly the same rate as they're added.  

2. there is not necessarily an odd number of justices to prevent ties. But this is already possible today when a justice recuses or retires, and the tie-break procedure is already in place (the decision of the lower court stands).

Benefits:

1. it would reduce the influence of any one judge on outcomes.  the impact of extremists would be minimized.

2. the composition of the court would reflect the country's overall political viewpoint, rather than the randomness of when justices happen to retire or die

3. justices would be less pressured to overstay their term in an attempt to avoid replacement by one president or another

8200,"We all want the tenth Fast and Furious movie to be called ""FasTEN Your Seatbelts"", but hear me out...","...because the tenth *Fast and Furious* film should be the franchise's Halloween special, simply known as *Fast and Furious Presents: Dominic Torretto's Thriller*. Think about it!

The plot will be even more insane and badass than ***any one of the previous movies*** ***in the motherfucking franchise***, with Dom celebrating Halloween with his self-proclaimed ""family"" with a family dinner at his place. The film will start off at nighttime and in foggy weather complete with a full moon out and stuff, and Dom tells the Fast crew that he's gonna go out and get some milk. He gets into his beloved car, and starts driving. This is when he starts to notice something is off. Due to the foggy weather, Dom cannot properly see where he is going, and this somehow lands him in a mysterious forest. One that was never seen before in any one of the previous films. There, Dom meets the main villain: some mysterious cloaked dude played by none other than Bob Odenkirk, who curses Dom with a spell that makes the world around him turn into none other than a **zombie apocalypse**. He notices that a whole bunch of street racers around him are turning into zombies. However, Bob Odenkirk tells Dom that, in order to break the curse, then he must race and then dance with the zombies. Therefore, our hero Dominic Torretto must save the world before shit hits the fan. All of this will somehow conclude with a parody of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" music video where Dom leads a dance number with zombified versions of many past characters in the franchise (and that also includes the *Hobbs and Shaw* film as well) such as Letty Ortiz (played by Michelle Rodriguez), Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne Johnson), Han Lue (played by Sung Kang), Ramsey (played by Nathalie Emmanuel), Deckard Shaw (played by Jason Statham), Gishele Yashar (played by Gal Gadot), Sean Boswell (played by Lucas Black), Jakob Torretto (played by John Cena), Mia Torretto (played by Jordana Brewster), Roman Pearce (played by Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (played by Ludacris), Hattie Shaw (played by Vanessa Kirby), and even Brian O'Conner (played by a stunt double since Paul Walker died in 2013, maybe one of his brothers). Even franchise baddies Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) and Brixton Lore (played by Idris Elba) are there. All of this complete with MJ's ""Thriller"" playing in the background, and the ending reveals it was all in Dom's head, because it's *Fast and Furious*, so if you can send our Fast crew into space in the ninth film, why not make the tenth a zombie apocalypse film that just so happened to take place in Vin Diesel's big bald head? The answer is easy af. Because it's *Fast and Furious*.

But if Vin Diesel and/or Universal Pictures want to do this, then they must make *Hobbs and Shaw 2* the franchise's Christmas special. Maybe something like *Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw's Holiday Heist*, a fun Christmas comedy for the whole family starring Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Vanessa Kirby, and Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain because why not?

- Workers can actually start taking home enough to live on.

8252,Creating the world's brain processing power,"This is what I believe happened with the Covid virus.  Take all the brainpower of the world's scientist to get together to develop a vaccine. Now what happened with the development of the Covid19 vaccine was that there were a large number of small groups working on a vaccine separately. All working independently in a race to be the first to provide a working vaccine. Taking the years it would have taken to create a vaccine down to less than a year. 

Now imagine if we took all the brainpower of everyone in the world and instead of having a large number of small groups working independently and competing with each other, we instead took the world's intelligence working together and cooperating with each other. We would come up with a vaccine cure in an instant. It would only take the cooperation with all nation's scientists. 

If you want to go further, we could have some sort of forum and have a bunch of low level amateur Virologist curate and moderate a message board and asking the general public to generate ideas to provide researchers with ideas. These low level amateur virologists or scientists would then filter out the ideas which may be possible or not possible and relay the possible vaccine solutions to mid level virus researchers, these mid level researchers can then filter these generated ideas even more and relay the possible working solutions to the main vaccine researchers. Creating a tiered solution approach. 

Going from the intelligence of the general public the main researchers. Crowd sourcing at its finest, creating a massive brain or the world's brain processing power. 

Now imagine there was an asteroid, and the whole world would be destroyed and everyone's life is at stake. I'm sure the whole world would get together and cooperate to solve this problem.",givemesomenews,1624420897

There might be adjustable variables, for things like slowing down time if unseen rocks on the ground become deadly as hell, different speed capabilities, speeds of sound or densities of air (so you can try listening to audio in reverse by going to the source when it's done and run in the direction it emitted it), and other things to mess with. If there's water sections, Sonic will be able to swim in some of them rather than put up with Eggman filling the pools with tap water. Naturally different media where the speed of sound differs would be nice to experiment with.

Also if you get the Chaos Emeralds, turn super and go at the speed of light, the game crashes because of Sonic generating something I call ""energy decay"" because I forgot the other thing a similar phenomenon was called. It's like vacuum decay, but basically you have a spherical kugelblitz thingy that proliferates at the speed of light because it contains infinite energy, and infinite time will have passed by the time it relatively experiences anything. (At infinite time, because numbers aren't as definite as they are when they're finite, there's pretty much a vague nothingness.) You could have special relativity physics as well and have a toggle for disabling light-speed potential. Also if you get the Super Emeralds and go faster than that, the game deletes itself (albeit scriptedly) due to interaction with ""impossible numbers"" which are larger than absolute infinity and transcend positivity. You can get numbers other than zero if you multiply zero by an impossible number, since zero isn't positive, negative or hypercomplex, and it's balanced on every possible hypercomplex number axis, and forcing it to become unbalanced without blatant addition/subtraction or whatever requires an impossible number.

It is my wish to show and teach my son the values of working together towards a better society.  Our charity will ABSOLUTELY succeed atleast 1 time because I will be donating to it as I get paid from my job and before we perish Lord willing we will be able to complete at least ONE complete Crowdfunding campaign.  The reason I say one is because I wish this social Crowdfunding idea to go viral and thus it would be a resetting and Perpetual crowdfund meaning that the moment it reaches 100K then one citizen recieves the 100K cash , the Crowdfunding resets to zero dollars and starts again repeatedly. It can take years to complete one 100K crowdfund or it can literally take minutes  because it depends on the users to get involved. We seek advise, criticism and idea that you may think we should incorporate into our idea.

I will like to point out that I am not a racist or hater but since this app will cost considerably cheaper I will be land locking the APP to only the U.S.A. and other nations can just copy my idea if they want to join so bad.

The way we will operate our social Crowdfunding Charity is as follows.  

1) Anyone can join and create an account as long as you live in the USA

 2) lets pretend our marketing on social media  goes mega viral and the day we launch our APP in the GooglePlayStore or iOS store immediately 20,000 Americans join the app

3) Now we can start the social charity Crowdfunding 

4)  When 10,000 Lovely philanthropic  American citizens step forward and donate a total of 10 dollars each the final amount will equal 100K cash and now from the remaining 10,000 Americans inside the app that did NOT donate 10 dollars then 1 will be randomly selected and awarded the 100,000 cash to be Individually financially free and try to make for a better society. 

5) The person MUST mandatory come forward and declare how they did NOT donate but yet was blessed with 100,000 cash.... so now the social Crowdfunding app resets back to zero dolllars and we start crowdfunding again.

6) lets pretend we go MEGA viral on our social media and now more Americans join and so now we have 60,000 Americans inside the social Crowdfunding APP....... the formula is the same and will NEVER change ..... from the 60,000 Americans in the app when any 10,000 Lovely philanthropic Americans step forward with 10 dollar donation each now again....from the 50,000 Americans remaining that did not donate then ONE will recieve tge 100,000 cash and the Crowdfunding resets to zero and we start again. 

7) lets pretend we go mega mega mega viral on social media and now 1 Million Americans download and join our app...... THE SAME FORMULA because remember it will never change no matter the amount of people that join the app the formula is the same.... when the amount of any 10,000 Lovely philanthropic Americans step forward with a 10 dollar donation then from the remaining 990,000 Americans that did not donate then ONE will recieve the 100,000 cash and the Crowdfunding resets back to zero dollars and again....from the 1 million Americans inside the app we just simply wait for 10,000 Lovely Philanthropic Americans to step forward and donate 10 dollars each and offer 100k cash to make another American Individually financially free to take a shot at the American dream.

8) The theory and analogy here is simple, we are combating greed and hatred with divine love ! Because example; if you have understood our APP you will know that during the Crowdfunding of a 100K campaign if I wish to be eligible to recieve the 100K then you  simply do NOT donate and simply wait lingering  until another 10,000 Americans step forward and donate their 10 dollars each and they have disqualified themselves and EVERYONE in the app that did not donate then one is selected to recieve the 100K cash and so example if a greedy and evil American downloads our app and say "" this app is bullshit scam and I will NEVER be a part of the 10,000 that donate 10 bucks so we can set free financially one American and instead I will NEVER donate that way I will only be eligible to recieve.....so the theory is a person with this evil mentality joins app and NEVER donates and I pray sometimes these Americans are randomly selected to recieve the 100K because their negative greed and hatred can be cured.

9) remember in our Charity Crowdfunding app if you wish to be eligible and want to recieve the 100K cash then simply do not donate.... however....if you are feeling charitable and philanthropic then anytime you wish you can be part of the 10,000 that donates 10 dollars and together you all will have set one American to be financially free.  So the Crowdfunding will reset back to zero and now you can just relax, feel good because last Crowdfunding you donated 10 bucks and thus disqualified yourself from being eligible to recieve the 100K cash and so this next Crowdfunding you just wait and relax until a random group of 10,000 Americans donate 10 dollars disqualified themselves.....but now YOU and everyone else inside the app that did not donate this time is eligible and will recieve the 100k.

10) Many people will have to read this a few times to understand and grasp the formula and concept of this charity Crowdfunding.  Read it a few times and please offer suggestions so that we can update and in a few year my son and I will actually have this  Charity APP developed and deployed for us all Americans to unite ,crowdfund and offer one by one individual financial freedom to take a shot at the American dreams.",BigPapiPR83,1624282825

Basic living expenses and a monthly allowance will be provided.

During the time there, these individuals will come to understand what it means to live in a different culture, and come to appreciate how no one culture is better than another.

They will come to understand just how idiotic and ignorant their views were, and upon return, have a significantly opposing stance to racism.

Most of these guys never get the opportunity to travel and really SEE.  This program is meant to give them this chance.

It's not a lot of money, but enough to help with bills or whatever. I'm looking to see what people think about it. I put it all down on a website and started an online petition.

The goal of the **Good Health Initiative Tax Rebate** is to promote better health.  This would be an optional participation tax rebate that can be filed for when filing regular annual taxes by individuals.  People filing jointly can include rebate paperwork for each person.  People not filing regular annual taxes cannot participate in the rebate.  The Good Health Initiative Tax Rebate would simply be a single page document filled out by a healthcare or certified personal training professional, within 30 days of filing taxes.

8487,I've had this idea for a while with nothing to do about it. Ecjectable car doors.,"The idea was, in case of emergency, **eject the doors**. Breaking glass is both hard and dangerous. Making easily breakable glass isn't an option. So, when a car is submerged in water, there isn't an easy way to escape. The doors are sometimes impossible to open in these situations due to water pressure.  But if there was a way to eject the doors in these situations, it might save a few lives. 

I first thought that it could be an automatic detection. But someone in my family pointed out the dangers of electricity and water. Plus, thinking about it now, it could create more problems than it would solve. It would need to be a lever that can't be accidentally pulled but would use hydraulics to detach the doors. (I have no idea how hydraulics work.) 

In theory, your car submerges, you panic. You have nothing to break the glass with, and the doors won't open until the pressure equalizes. You don't have time to wait for the cabin to fill for the pressure to equalize because you would be too deep to surface.  So you pull the emergency handle ejecting all the doors and giving you more ways to escape. But that's not all. Say your car is on fire and you need to escape quickly. Eject the doors! If you are in a crash and you don't know what door will work. Eject the doors!  It would make it easier for first responders to reach the victims as well! 

I don't know how engineering or the logistics of this would work. But I think the base idea might be useful.",that-other-one------,1623922920

8511,Electromagnetic Kinetic Powered Devices,"I originally had the idea while daydreaming and going down a mountain pass while as a child. The idea came to me because my father would often turn the engine off and coast down the mountain and his obsession with gyroscopes.

The idea was to make gyrosphere cars powered by inertia and electromagnetics and kinetic energy. The driver or more like rider would be kept stabilized by sitting in the stabilized gyrosphere. As the ""ball"" rolled downhill it would build inertia and kinetic energy and run powerlessly. The power then created would collectively charge the electromagnetic rail system to use the power of electrically charged magnets to push the device forward. And converting to a unison speed rail system would prevent impact and traffic the problem then is when you want to go somewhere that isn't charged. Also, the driver doesn't really need to drive? Pertaining to the balance and centering of the passenger compartment of the gyrosphere the device would be leveled by the inner chamber having an opposing charged pole in conjunction with the rail system. The friction with the outer layer would also help towards building kinetic energy.

I have had this idea since I was a child and now wish to see if it is viable.",H-QueenGoddess,1623873834

Had a thought to design a GPS receiver into a dummy package (something cheap- could even be as simple as a burner phone) along with a note saying 'I now know where you live, the police are on their way 🙂'

Process: 
People would place the package outside their door and leave it there. It would look just like an Amazon package (even be in the Amazon box) so there's no way to tell a dummy package from a real one. We capture and consolidate the tracking data to identify the individuals that are stealing packages most frequently in the neighborhood

Benefit: 
If nothing else It would be a relatively cheap way to scare the s*** out of people who steal packages so they think twice about it or risk getting caught.

Also, in theory they're bringing it back to the same place that they bring other packages (their house) so we should be able to see overtime where these packages are landing.

8544,PPV access to riots /w features such as buy-in supply airdrops.,"Basically like Hunger Games, Post-Apocalyptic society, and gladiatorial combat combined.


Offer PPV access to active riots with the option of airdropping weapons, supplies, etc, to the rioters for a price.

**For $229.99/day, you get up close access to the riots as they go! Multiple feeds! Add to the violence with aid drops and sustainability items! 

The money they’d make off this initiative would be astronomical.

$5,500 for an assault rifle with 3 clips! $4,000 for a girder to be dropped in the middle of a selected roadway to prevent cops from access! $2,499.99 for 1500 steel jacks to pop vehicle tires and shut down a roadway! $599.99 for a crate or 15 Molotov cocktails!! Oh but that’s not all, $300.00 for a machete, $250 for a replica of Negan’s bat, Lucille, from the walking dead, or maybe something as simple as a crate of water bottles or cheese burgers! and MORE!**

In addition you have sponsorship deals like airdrops done by Amazon, McDonalds supplies food, Dasani supplies water, some survivalist company sponsors weapon drops. And more!**

There’s be an Estimated economical cost damage meter and a casualty counter, with an interactive overhead map of faction control over sections of the city.

With 3rd party global access, there’d be millions of subscribers around the globe, bringing in billions of dollars a day, potentially!!",Marzton,1623819517

8560,Homeless City,"Like that South Park episode where they bus out all the homeless people from Denver.What if we actually had a city for the homeless to go to?

Where ever in America, you would be able to get a free bus ticket to Homeless City.  You don't have to use the ticket, but the city officials have already told you its illegal to camp in the city now, so you might as well go.

How would it work?The homeless love L.A. and that's for good reason.  It never rains, its not too hot or too cold.  Its the perfect weather to be outside all day everyday.At the same time, its disgusting.  They throw trash everywhere, needles on the sidewalk, poop in the street, you can smell them from blocks away.  Its changing L.A. from a city of sunshine to a city of stink and filth.  But they could pass a law down there that says absolutely no Homeless allowed, making it illegal to camp out.  If you have a tent on the sidewalk, a police officer comes up and tells you that you cannot be homeless in L.A. anymore.  You will be provided with a 1 way ticket to Homeless City and asked to either leave the city or take the bus, those are your options.

Now, what can be done to make Homeless City something different from Gaza 2.0?  Or some kind of open air prison we send our problems to.  Obviously, it would be good to get homeless people out of the city, but we'd need to give them a place to go that is humane.

I think for starters, where ever homeless city was put, ideally it'd have weather like L.A.  Little rain, not too hot, not too cold.  So maybe somewhere close to a river or a lake.  When it gets too hot, go for a swim.  This would also give them a way to feed themselves by fishing.  They could shower and wash their clothes in the river too.  Personally, I'd put this possibly on the Columbia River in a town like Mayger or Lindbergh.  Right on the river with land that currently belongs to the govt.   It has to be enough land for half a million people.  Or perhaps the Northern Channel Islands.  Next step is to create a welfare system.  Food stamps.  We could work with a grocery store to put a huge market in Homeless City and essentially give them free food, tax payers pay for it.  This is how it is in my city of Portland Oregon.  The difference is that this would be Federally funded, because homeless people would get bussed here from all over the country.

Lastly, we need a way to get out of Homeless City.  It can't be this place your sent to and stay until you die.  That's not humane.  So we'd need like some kind of way out.  The problem is that some (not all) of the homeless are essentially broken people or mentally ill.  Its pretty hard to do anything with people like this.  If you've been a meth/crack/heroine addict for a decade living on the street, you might literally have brain damage.  To the point where you couldn't hold down a job even if you were given the chance.  So to be honest, sending these types to Homeless City where they can stink, do nothing, and have free food and shelter might be the best you could do with them.",PaleontologistWest,1623791765

Maybe there'd be a short bio of any notable busts they've made, or maybe even notable (to describe it politely) *misuses of authority*.

Maybe there'd be a monetary total value of all the drugs and illegal paraphernalia they've seized over their careers.

Maybe there'd be special detective cards equivalent to like a pitcher card, with special detective stats like murder cases solved, suspects interrogated vs. suspects that end up confessing to their crimes. Maybe their bio would hold notable cold cases or serial offenders they've busted.

Maybe rookie cards will be more valuable if the officer goes on to do great things, or maybe if they go on to do terrible things who knows? I don't actually collect baseball cards, and so I really don't know if rookie cards are more or less valuable. Do any of you know?

Goodwill/thrift stores manage to recycle some donated, but there are not enough volunteer labor force to sort, label and sell these products. Given there being more important things to do, it is also an inefficient usage of labor.

What if we simply lay them out on the ground as a ""scrap yard"", use a drone/bot to take photos of the items, and ""product image search""  these products in a database, list and price them automatically?

Buyers could find the item with a phone app, navigate them to the item's location.

Since these items are usually donated, we don't really need much revenue to keep the business afloat.

The costs are rent of a parking lot, or unimproved land covered by tarp, operating cost of the drone/bot and maybe some security cameras, and cost of the ""product image search"" service.

I really think that if the human species makes it to Mars we have just increased our species' survival greatly, it would give us decades if not centuries of more time to figure out how to reach planets beyond our solar system and populate those as well.

Once we populate, say, just 4 planets total - including earth and mars, nature would be hellbent to take the human race out. Not a single catastrophic event could wipe our species from the face of existence if we become spread out amongst the stars.

Some of the most intelligent people I know are the black sheep in our families.

That drunk brother, who everyone thinks is a bother and he no longer bothers anyone. You know that sister who never finished high school and married some wielder in some forgotten town in your county? The one that you rarely call, the one whose kids you make nannies? Yeah. Those ones, are full of love. 

Save for making an accurate observation about the family, most black sheep rarely gossip or harbour any ill-will. They have accepted their fate, will drink themselves to an early grave or of a married and forgotten woman, will stick by her husband and live quietly.

They will come to family function and rarely voice their opinion. Because in Africa, anyone with money, has the say. They are sidelined. Talked down to.

And those doing slightly better off (due to luck, often) are super judgmental, super dismissive and crazily entitled. 

But if you want to know the truth a family, talk to a black sheep. Black sheep know a lot that they keep to themselves because we never value their input.

Don't ever, ever despise or treat a sibling or a relation on account of a weakness like addiction, or poverty or such. Whatever you do, be you, but love and respect everyone equally.

I know so many black sheep, living in slums, quite happier, than their brothers and sisters living in better neighborhoods. Not a good comparison. But did you know there are guys in prison who are freer than those of us chained to this life of sin.",Brief-Resolve-5765,1623440440

8723,A hypothesis that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars.," The FED can use Mars to set interest rates. A new book called ""The Mars Hypothesis"" presents the idea that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars. In this book, data going back to 1896 shows that as of April 2020, percentage-wise, the Dow Jones rose 857%. When Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896, the Dow rose 136%. When Mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node, the Dow rose 721%. Mars retrograde phases during the time Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node. The purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars, but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time, formulate a system that would enable the Federal Reserve to carry out its application in real time. Using the observation of the planet Mars, the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation, interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year 2098.

After death, dispose of corpses by feeding them to tigers.","The US has a larger captive tiger population than are found in the wild worldwide. Additionally, due in part to environmental concerns, people in recent years have sought alternate burial methods, like composting, ocean burial, etc, as an alternative to burial/cremation. Let's kill two birds with one and go for an environmental double-whammy. We'll help sustain tiger populations and dispose of corpses in a way that takes very little energy and no permanent land use.

Plus, there are some fringe benefits. First, it's just downright badass. I don't want to rot in the ground. No, fuck that, I want my corpse to be eaten by a god-damned tiger. Also, think of the funerary practices the method would entail. Instead of a somber lowering of a corpse into the ground, you have a giant party. Lots of eating and drinking, in an atmosphere akin to when Romans watched prisoners being fed to the lions in the Colosseum.  Everyone stuffs themselves full and gets sloppy drunk. Then, there's a great big dramatic countdown, and *The Circle of Life* is blasted from speakers. Finally, instead of carrying your casket, the pallbearers swing your corpse in unison and heave it right over the fence into the tiger pen.

Then the tigers get a free meal and your corpse is disposed of in a process that requires no fuel burning or electricity of any kind. Hungry tigers are fed, and they're moved just the smallest distance further away from extinction.

8781,A political party that is also a social network alternative to FB/Twitter/reddit/etc,"Machine politics in the US, think Tammany Hall or anywhere else that patronage was key to winning elections, was actually a network of individuals who knew each other irl and was a community organization of personal relationships, a social network. Precinct caprains who if they were successful would get a job with the city/county/state while still needing to provide government services to all (possibly skipping garbage pick up for the opposition precinct captains, but everyone else), this has been described as 'honest graft' which obviously was not efficient but it was responsive to the electorate more so than the current alienated electorate is. Hundred years ago political campaigns were obviously without ads or any broadcast media, so instead were reliant on the labor heavy action of party activists leveraging their own personal relationships to deliver votes for their slate of candidates.
 
My proposal would be to have a mixture of irl political organizing (doorknocking, small social gatherings in living rooms, neighborhood rallies/townhalls, etc) but also have an online parallel social network where along with polling members on their elected officials on whether or not they should support specific legislation and which candidate gets the party's nomination - but also sharing jokes, memes, and the rest of what social media provides to maintain attention with the main feature being it would be ad-free and tracker-free and user accounts are given with ability to post and comment either via a monthly subscription or irl activity (doorknocking or someother volunteer service), viewing your stream would always be free. Users would have their voter information associated with their account, and if a party member were elected they would beholden to their party member's polling result on specific pieces of legislation if they went against their own constituents on a bill or other vote then they would be barred from being renomimated on the party's ballot line. Just like prior era political bosses would have to be responsive to the party members, but instead of being rewarded with government jobs the electorate would get elected officials to be primarily beholden to them and their political will. This type party building has an intrinsic community building and social value being created in the participating in the community and their government, which has been lacking in American politics for 50-60 years and seems to be trending to an even more alienated electorate going forward; elected officials are more likely to be hyper responsive to big dollar donors than even their own party activists or constituents and the constituents are alienated from each other as less and less social interactions occur outside of algorithms bent on maximize profits rather than build communities.
 
The biggest hurdle for this would be the on boarding a critical mass to the social network that would be a good place to waste time on, but once there was a critical mass the social benefits of having real community and empowerment in one's own government it would create a virtuous cycle that would self-sufficient. A third party candidate doesn't need to win a majority of the vote, merely a plurality and once there are elected officials who are tightly held accountable for their votes by their participating constituents it would generate another virtuous cycle that the other parties would likely attempt to ape, thereby reducing the corruption in government and making politics more responsive to the public regardless of the outcome of the elections. The point of referring to the antiquated way of politicking was demonstrate just how recent it had been to not have politics be centered on community (just a different, yet IMHO preferable, form of corruption) we could have the best of both worlds and have politics be hyper responsive to the public rather willfully ignoring the people, plus an alternative to attention mongers and data miners that we have in FB/Twitter/reddit/YouTube/etc.",SeanFromQueens,1623285629

Despite the two countries' recent history of hate, there are actually more things that bind the two nations together.

They have very similar, yet different cultures.  Even linguistically, it's actually easier for a Korean to learn Japanese than Chinese, for instance.  The foods we eat appear different, yet are actually closer in actually than Korean food to Chinese food, for instance.  The relationship dynamics (family, friendships, work ethics, school life) are so close that it's surreal.

And economically, they would prosper if they unified.

In fact, they are linked closely already.  During the 80s, Korea made most of the merchant ships the Japanese were using, for instance.  

An economic union would immensely open up opportunities for joint ventures into an ever expanding Asian market which would yield benefits to both sides.

8825,A couple of ideas for education: visualizing math and no English requirements in 11th and 12th grade.,"I can only imagine how much easier it would probably be to teach kids math with something they can see. I can't explain it, but to see how something moves around and gets cut up into sections and such would probably make it easier to visualize mathematics. For example: You have one square; a line of 10 squares = 10; 10 rows of those lines = 100; a cube of those rows of those lines = 1000. Just to make kids see it may help them understand how multiplication works.

About English, in the US (at least North Carolina), you're required to learn English in all 4 high school grades. In 9th and 10th, it's word part (prefixes, suffixes, word roots, etc.). In 11th and 12th grade, you're learning words that use the root words, some of which don't make any sense. Conciliatory, iconoclast, preclude, anachronistic, divergent. I learned some of these words in passing, sure, especially video games, but are incredibly rare to hear these. I learned of divergent from, um... the movie Divergent. Instead, the last 2 years of high school should lean into pre-college courses, such as nursing, engineering, etc.",Ninjhetto,1623190446

8889,A game show that 'rewards' Twitter's most racist US based posters.,"We offer $10m in prizes as incentive to show the cancelled culture goons that real Americans can handle anything. We rate their posts and pick the 'best' 1000 to compete. We even fly them all to the location of the competition, San Pedro Sula, Hondurus. After getting through customs into the country, we take all their possessions and their passports as per the contract which only the dumbest (so probably 1000 of the first 1052) will probably just sign even you put that in bold. Now, they need to find their way to New York City without calling family, friends, followers or any government in the world. Each contestant gets a bag with a massive battery and long retractable cords to power a camera and recharge said battery. The contestant will have to record everything. The first person to make it Time Square wins $2m US, 2nd person gets a million, 3rd place is $500k, 4th $250k, $125k for fifth, $62.5k for 6th, $31.25k for 6th. Anyone else can spin the Will of Destiny for further prizes. Any violation of rules will eliminate the contestants.

  


We make our money of micro transactions that allow betting on anything possible. The following but not limited to:

  


first to quit and then second and so on;

  


first to break a particular rule and so on;

  


first to cry and so forth;

  


first to get arrested or so forth;

  


first to get in a confrontation and so forth;

  


first to say something racists and so forth;

  


first to make a homophobic remark and so forth;

  


first to get deported and so forth;

  


first to face criminal charges and so forth;

  


first to leave Hondorus and so forth with the ability to parlay with destination and how;

  


first to the US border and so forth;

  


first to have follower, family or friends help them and so forth;

  


first to NYC and so forth with great multiple finish prediction parlays.

  


  


We don't run the betting, just collect very reasonable fees. We also stream everything with up to 8 simulcasts per device at a time. We use alerts to announce losers. We actually don't notify them until NYC so maybe a few cheaters will make the entire trek, in vain. Daily highlight, weekly review and best of will be curated for our channel. We pick edgier companies to pitch advertising opportunies. We just randomly program very short ads with a button that will allow anyone to see an ad again and/or more info. We encourage little subversive behaviors likes long lunches ON THE CLOCK, using sick time to play hookey, using a company slush funds to bet, watching the contests while trying to work, etc- all with warnings that we are just joking (wink, wink/nudge, nudge, know what I mean?). We sell merchandise as cheaply as we can and still turn a profit. We employee Samuel L Jackson to greet and congratulate the 'winners' and inform the non winners of their disqualification or placing.

  


  


We call the game Eye of the Tiger since Survivor is already taken. I'm sure the band, Survivor, could use some more royalties. Maybe it even kicks a renewed interest in their music.

  


We officially don't welcome micro transaction on violent crime possibility bets and won't accidentally promote anyone who takes said bets (wink/wink, nudge/nudge, know what I mean?).

  


The celebrity edition will have a exotic locale and different rewards like Sadr City and pardons for crimes.

  


The celebrity team game will take place in Mogadishu where each team of 6 will have to work together to get to London. They will each get handcuff together with a 1000 keys spread around them in the darkest room we can create. They will have to figure out how to get out of said room even before getting our of Somalia. Winning teams will receive untold riches (President for Life, vice President, Secretary of State, Chief of Staff for the National Military, Director of the National Police, and Captain of National Industry for Newest Sealand, a oil derrick turned microstate in the North Atlantic).",RegularSizedP,1623039092

8897,"An alternative version of Star Wars: A New Hope, but from the perspective of Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader.","If you watch Star Wars in canonical order, there is a jarring shift of the story perspective jumping from the Prequels two main characters. It could be interesting to see the similar storyline, but with the twins and Han Solo being the B plot to the final showdown between Obi Wan and Anakin. 

Imagine the tension building that could result, as the story follows Obi Wan rescuing Luke and then realizing that his plans for the padawan have to be accelerated. He doesn't want to join up with the Rebel Alliance, but sees that the Force (which moves and guides the universe) brought Leia to Tatooine. He now has to pick up his lightsaber and go back into one final battle. 

He beat Anakin last time and left him for dead. He doesn't know if he can face his best friend again. 

From Vader's perspective, the storyline follows how he has premonitions through the Force that Obi Wan is alive. The Emperor tells him that he has foreseen another showdown between the former Master and Apprentice. 

This makes the final lightsaber battle way more iconic and jarring. Especially the final sacrifice. This can also be used as a way to hand the torch onto Luke and Leia for the saga to continue.

As if they did something wrong and were kicked out of a ""home"" they may or may never have had. No family to take them in.

A person ""Without Shelter"" simply means they have nowhere long term to sleep at night or shelter at during the day.

It means they still belong in society... this town and this city is still their hometown... BUT they simply don't have any ""shelter"" currently.

This will help develop Africa because they'll have a more intelligent population that will create industries and institutions that can help propel Africa forward.

Judges let them off the hook and departments shuffle them around to different jurisdictions. That’s if they don’t get an early retirement. So what can we do, the civil public between criminals and cops (and the real problem: those who are indistinguishable from either group) to deliver justice? There should be a publicly tracked database that businesses can use to deny service. Commerce is one of our greatest tools in America and in a way it is a parallel force to democracy. Spending money is voting. So imagine a cop shoots a suspect who is not resisting, or perhaps was lethally forceful with a suspect due to racial prejudice. If this database was used, the offending officer could be locked out of purchasing groceries, fuel, luxuries, etc. They would be forced to rely on family and friends. Their crime would become a burden. Prison outside of prison. There would be kinks to work out, obviously, but I think this would be helpful. Just a thought.",artmoloch777,1622886054

I'd imagine there would have to be a deep fake company that screens scripts and projects for actors before anybody can purchase a license. They could also employ hundreds of VFX artists *and* hundreds of celebrity impersonators for the production teams. 

Actors can choose how much they want to be incorporated in a project. Let's take Harrison Ford instance. Let's say he's ready to retire but still wants to create new royalty revenue without much input. He'd put up access to use his likeness through a licensing fee. All of a sudden the following year, we see hundreds of short films and small feature films with Harrison Ford in it. The better the impersonator, the better the deep fake, the better the movie. 

But what if actors want some input? Heck they can even provide their voice samples. What if actors want to set up their estate For Life? After they pass, they can license off their likeness and voice samples all they want.

8999,"Up to $30,000 from Konstruktor will be awarded to the winner of its international startup competition. Large investments from the US company Konstruktor will go to the Lemonade project Kazakhstan. A relatively young girl has won the startup contest.","The first international award for ""Best Startup of the Year"" was given out by the American technology company [Konstruktor](https://konstruktor.com/) on May 22nd in the city of Almaty, Kazakhstan.

The winner of the [KonstruktorStart competition](https://konstruktor.com/Article/view/980) is the [Lemonade project](https://konstruktor.com/Article/view/988) by Ekaterina and Tamara Strelnikova, which will receive up to $30,000 in investments from the American technology company Konstruktor.

The prize was presented by a special representative of the Konstruktor company, who arrived in Almaty from the United States to personally congratulate Ekaterina and Tamara on their well-deserved victory.

The American technology company ""[Konstruktor](https://konstruktor.com/)"" was founded in 1999 by Vlad Krishtop. Konstruktor’s mission is to support creative and artistic initiatives of people from all over the world and to create the best conditions to develop them. Konstruktor is also a unique global community, a creative environment, with more than 1 million members from 190 countries.

Konstruktor is part of a group of companies managed by the parent investment company [Second Working District](http://www.secondworkingdistrict.com/) in California. Most recently, the primary interest of the company has been investments in the intellectual sphere as well as looking for innovative projects and assisting in their realization.

With this goal in mind, Konstruktor and the Second Working District announced a competition for the best startup project called KonstruktorStart. The placing of competing projects and the application submission for the competition all took place on the Konstruktor website. More than 1000 different projects from all over the world were submitted for the competition.

According to the KonstruktorStart jury, the selection process was difficult. However it was Ekaterina and Tamara Strelnikova from Kazakhstan and their startup project Lemonade that deservedly received first prize and up to $30,000 in investment to further develop their project with the help of Konstruktor.

The Lemonade project (Leap Motion Navigation of Deaf) by Ekaterina and Tamara Strelnikova is a project to create an interactive simulator that will help children with hearing impairments, as well as their parents, to master both sign language and the sign alphabet.

The project is innovative, high-tech, has practical application and solves a specific existing problem. At the same time, this is a solidarity project. Initially, the idea of creating a product that would facilitate communication and integration of children with hearing difficulties arose as a personal situation for the creators’ family. However, the use of such a simulator can in fact improve the quality of life of more than 360 million people in the world who are deaf or hearing impaired. In this case, we can talk about the global nature of the project as well as its commercial appeal.

Ekaterina Strelnikova was the project’s ideological inspiration and her mother, Tamara, was the project’s technical consultant. Despite her relatively young age, at 20 Ekaterina already teaches programming and has been developing her own projects since she was young. Her mother Tamara is a professional Python developer. Together, they were not only able to learn about Konstruktor, but they were also able to present an original project and create its successful presentation and promotion.

Today Lemonade technology is already at the implementation stage and is being applied in practice at Boarding School 1 in Almaty.

The presentation of first prize to the winners of the KonstruktorStart startup competition was an important event for Konstruktor itself, which plans to continue supporting enthusiasm, intelligence, professionalism and entrepreneurship. And from future information, Konstruktor will also continue to create a space for creativity, dreams and cooperation.

However, there now exists early forms of code-writing AI (I think based on GPT-3?) and the field is one which computers should improve in more quickly than many others.

It should be simple enough for AI to do successive rewrites up through programming language levels, and then the trickiest bit would be teaching it how to structure, organize and intelligently tighten the code to mimic a project written in high-level code by an experienced developer following a well designed master plan.

Then just turn it loose spidering the web for binaries, reverse engineering them, even doing a cursory check for backdoors and then sharing the results as torrents and short-lived githubs.

One determined python pusher could unleash a persistently-connected borgnet of AI code cloners that could then keep guerilla-opening proprietary code in perpetuity unless the software is kept solely in cold storage.  And along the way potentially contribute to closing security holes - especially those introduced deliberately now that we know Noone Secured Anything - plus tightening inefficient code, and porting every application across every platform and even turning complex software suites into cloud web apps.  Malware detection would probably greatly improve, and surreptitiously malicious code wouldn't be a factor cause the AI would be presenting operations in an objectively honest way.

Or everything would look like it's been run through a code obfuscator, but ideally not would be the final goal.

They can dress up in their plate carriers and night vision, run around with their guns and play out missions from a set list using live ammo. 

Targets and partial funding provided by DARPA - why? Because now their tech has a live-fire test bed against semi-trained civilians and ex-military, a neo-fascist corpo's wet dream. 

Legal cover and liability is handled by an army of lawyers on the government's payroll - why? Because in exchange they now have a corral for the FBI/CIA/ATF and all the other 3-letter agencies to monitor comms and tactics being used by insurgent groups, lone wolves, and other dissidents. 

Later official teams can be formed under a governing body to compete. Body cams, drones, and the like will provide high octane action for viewers at home with franchising and pay per view options with the major networks - a sport for and by Americans.

And finally, perhaps most importantly, calming political tensions. I'm convinced a majority of the people dressing up like commandos at protests the last several years weren't all that committed to the realities of a fascist coup or a bloody civil war. I think they're semi-agitated LARPers caught up in the political momentum and that running around at their local shooting range plinking at steel silhouettes got boring.

9035,Chocopoly,"Ok so we all know about the boring old original Monopoly game, but why not spice it up a little? Me and a few others came up with an idea for a Monopoly game based on chocolate, with the rules as follows:

1. You may retire at any time and freeze your possessions where they stand for the rest of the game, but only after you settle any debts (so that means you can't roll a six, see that it will land you on Mayfair and instantly say ""I retire"" before moving). When a player wins the game, all players are now entitled to eat their chocolates and the game is finished.

2. There is a chocolate assigned for each set, and at the end of the game you are entitled to receive this chocolate if you have the set. ALL PROPERRIES IN THE SET MUST NOT BE MORTGAGED.

3. Each house entitles you to half a Jaffa (or any other nominated small chocolate) at the end of the game, but your total number of Jaffas is rounded down (if you end up with 3.5 Jaffas, you only receive 3). THESE TOO MUST NOT BE MORTGAGED.

4. Each hotel entitles you to three Jaffas, but since you need to give in your houses on a property to purchase a hotel you also lose the Jaffas for those houses as well (which is still an upgrade, as four houses are only worth 2 Jaffas). AGAIN, THESE MUST NOT BE MORTGAGED.

5. If you are playing the rule where all taxes and similar payments to the bank are given into the middle to be collected by the next player who lands on the Free Parking square, this money is first converted into chocolate coins based on a set exchange rate. These coins are able to be used as cash (based on the exchange rate), but you may not buy chocolate coins directly from the bank.

6. All money earned directly through Chance, Community Chest and the Utility squares is also given in chocolate coins, based on the exchange rate mentioned above.

7. If a player is in Jail and wishes to attempt to break out by rolling a double, they must instead purchase a Clinker for 50 dollars and bite it. If the Clinker is green, they are free to go and may roll the dice to move. If the Clinker is yellow, they are released on their next turn. If the Clinker is red, they do not escape.

8. When a player passes Go, they may choose to receive a nominated chocolate (such as 4 M&amp;Ms) instead of the 200 dollars.

9. ALL CHOCOLATES MUST NOT BE EATEN UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME unless it is a Go-square chocolate or a legitimately purchased Clinker for Jail-breaking purposes

10. (somewhat contraversial) If anyone illegally takes a chocolate, all their possessions return to the board and they are now kicked from the game.

So yeah, there's the rules. I highly appreciate any feedback, and hope to get these rules pretty much balanced.",AshKmo33,1622717954

Siege towers were good for getting onto the tops of walls, but were very heavy. Also, lots of climbing involved which I imagine wore the soldiers out before they even got on top of the walls.

Enter the [Trebuchet Siege Tower](https://imgur.com/YqL7qPo)!

Load soldiers onto the platform, wheel it up to the walls, and release the counterweight - the platform arcs over and lands on the walls.

If I built it IRL I'd just anchor it down rather than using balloons, obviously - I just did it this way cos it's not so easy to build angled stuff in Besiege. Also I'd probably use a Mangonel style rather than a Trebuchet (trying to make the tower as light and mobile as possible).

This idea would have the bonus effect of killing any defenders on the wall who happened to be beneath the platform when it landed - their bodies would cushion the arm's arrival. 

Also, the soldiers on the platform would be shielded (by the rest of the machine) until the moment they are launched, at which point they'll only be visible to the enemy for a few brief moments - and travelling very fast, high above the defenders - before they land on the wall.

There's probably a very good reason why this wasn't used in siege warfare... hence me posting it on r/Crazyideas!",Pesto_Power,1622676416

9106,Kitchen appliances cleaning life hacks,"Sometimes, it is difficult to clean up the whole kitchen, while no one wants to live, especially cooking meals in a messy kitchen. So, I want to share with you the list of my life hacks on how to quickly and efficiently clean kitchen appliances. I’ve tried all of them, and I’ve come up with this idea when I had to clean my BF’s oven, which he hasn’t washed for the whole year.

&amp;#x200B;

To start with the oven, microwave, and hob. If you want to quickly and easily clean those grease appliances, you will need baking soda with vinegar. Next, you need to add a little dish detergent to the baking soda and vinegar, spread this mix on the dirty surfaces, and leave for 15-20 minutes. Then just wash off with warm water. The result will surprise you: what had to be scrubbed for a long time and tediously will be washed off quickly and easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Steam in the microwave can literally do wonders: just put a bowl of water in the microwave or oven and let the water boil well. Then, all you have to do is wipe the oven walls with a damp cloth. Also, this life hack will help you easily clean the multicooker, in particular the lid and the valve for the steam outlet.

&amp;#x200B;

To clean surfaces in the fridge, you need to wipe the shelves and walls with a mix of water and vinegar. Outside, you need to wipe the refrigerator with a sponge dipped in soapy water. Do not use metal scourers and brushes.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I found a few life hacks on cleaning a toaster, but I haven’t tried them yet. If you tried any of them, please share your experience in the comment section below.

Most of you know about the infamous Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas and how it has unhealthy foods and everyone over 350 lbs eats free. So what I am saying is there should be a restaurant that is the exact opposite of that. All the food is overly healthy (in other words its just salad bars and green juice dispensers) and everyone under 170 lbs eats free. Also, like how they have the sexy nurses at the Heart Attack Grill. They should have sexy personal trainers (in other words the waitresses wear sports bras and yoga pants) best of all, just like the other one seems like its jokingly promoting obesity (even though in the real word they probably don't care and are just doing for the jokes)",redditboy123451,1622515444

9272,Template Virtual Machine,"A single instance of the website is kept in memory.

*   The static data and dynamic sections in-memory template are indexed.
    
*   Widgets or common components are shared on different pages or nested views.
    
*   When a request comes in for a given page the regions are walked and transmitted.
    

All this does is replace the generation of the contiguous block of bytes \[static, dynamic, static, …\] with a higher-level representation of the output. Servlet layers and templating engines map the output page structure from many nested function calls and branching - the Template Virtual Machine essentially directly maps the blocks to the output. There may be the following benefits:

*   The clientside can subscribe to the backend blocks and be notified when they change.
    
*   Dynamic blocks are essentially holes that must be filled by programs.
    
*   DB performance can be measured and checked for errors.
    
*   Blocks can be shared between pages.
    
*   Potential parallelization of dynamic blocks. Non-static data can be streamed immediately and all future dynamic blocks can run at the same time providing there are no dependencies.
    

Similar:

*   [rendr](http://rendr.com/)
    
*   The idea of [String Templates](http://www.stringtemplate.org/) where all substitutions must be known in advance.

9290,A solution to paywall extortion,"I don’t want to see online ads. At all. They’re almost entirely scams, misinformation, or, worst of all, trackers. I also am not going to buy a subscription to a site to read one article. If I could actually micropay for a single article, i might do that, but no one has implemented a functional method for such micropayments. 

But if several online publishers worked together, there’s what I regard as an obvious solution: aggregated article payments. A person creates an account with an aggregator (a traditional one like Flipboard, or one created solely for this purpose) and buys packages of articles. An article credit is good for one article from any of the affiliated sites; some feature articles and/or premium sites might cost more than one credit. The more credits you buy at once, the better deal you get. 

The aggregator splits out the money from credit purchases to the affiliated sites, divided by any of a number of methods (small-traffic sites would benefit most from an even split, while large-traffic sites would benefit more from splitting according to traffic). As long as the site whose article you want to read is affiliated with the aggregator, and you have sufficient credits in your account, you don’t have to deal with ads or paywall beg notices, without having to tie yourself to to expensive subscriptions to multiple sites just to read a handful of articles a month.",ToothlessFeline,1622167736

9356,Views Of Data,"Applications such as wiki or ERP applications are typically monolithic where the full application is absolutely necessary to interact with the underlying data. Data conversion is needed to move data between ecosystems. Conversion is less useful than a view over data. When we have a view over data, we can use multiple tools to interact with the same data.  

*   If complex filtering or sorting behavior cannot be shifted to a database, it would be preferable if the data retrieved could still be queried as if it was. It is likely a dedicated querying module would give better performance than writing custom sorting and filtering. The same APIs for sorting and filtering used both the client and server.
    
*   Running database queries over a CSV/JSON/XML file
    
*   The data is displayed on a user interface in one window is useable by the user. The user can run a query against the list of emails or interpret the email body as a document in a different format.
    

Using views may be less efficient because data is not in an optimized data structure. For example, running a join query over a CSV file is likely to be slow. A view architecture could support this in the following ways:  

*   write handcrafted code that can support basic SQL functionality over text files
    
*   write a mapper that converts JSON/CSV/XML into insertions into a newly spun up database server or in-memory database
    

The user should not care what format or representation the data is in - only that they can interact with the data in multiple ways. It should be possible for many applications to operate on the same data structure.  

Existing examples:  

*   [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) compatible with MongoDB
    
*   Templating on the client and on the server
    
*   LINQ: functional queries over objects

Aubrey and Oscar how siblings, they are a witch and vampire respectively living in a family of the same being. To keep the families life going they need to make a sacrifice so Aubrey takes her friend Donald to meet her family.it’s a GET OUT type of situation where Donald is unknowing to the this situation and is there to finally visit his best friends family. Soon they reach Aubrey‘s family and a specific person peaks the eye of Donald. In order for the sacrifice to work A person not of there being my sacrifice the true person they love and Aubrey is full intent to sacrifice herself believing how close she and Donald have become. Once trapped Donald realizes what the family really is and tries to escape but it’s unsuccessful. He meets with Oscar and then to begin to grow find of each other with Oscar having a love-hate relationship with Donald. In a final scene Donald is cornered by the entire family and us told the truth that either he must die to keep the secret or he must kill the person he’s in love with and as it turns out he has fallen in love with Oscar and Oscar in love with him and is a part of the reason why Oscar has a hate relationship with him.

9365,Subs should let communities vote on whether or not to keep a user banned,"So I feel like one big problem with Reddit is power hungry people often get port opted to mod and use that to silence dissenting opinion in subs.

I think as a check against mods abusing their power in a sub we should have a list of banned users and the banned user can make a plea to the community itself about their ban. The mods can still have discretion about lifting bans but I think if we see a constant conflict between who a mod bans and who the community wants banned that mod should be removed.

This would be a way to stop mods who use their power to silence dissenting voices from a sub and end up turning many subs into echo chambers that keep feeding into the same false narratives that create misinformation compaigns on the left or right",Thetermibox,1621964654

9370,Rethinking Public Transportation,"Google Transportation

Scope: Seattle, WA. (Or any major city)

Problem: Congested roadways and growing population.

Effects of problem:
Increase in travel time causing wasted personal time.
Added stress.
Deterrent for people wanting to travel into the city for work and entertainment.

Current implements: Public Transportation, to include busses and Trams.

Proposed implement: Gondolas (like you see at ski resorts). AKA: Google Pods.

     Google Pods, a simple, fast and effective way to commute.

Why Google Pods?
     In an ever growing world focused on sharing our lives with others, people want privacy and security in most aspects of their life and this includes when they travel. Most people I know would rather spend 2+ hours in traffic in their own car over taking crowded public transportation with strangers.

So how does Google Pods work?
     Google Pods are a gondolas based system with stations at popular “Park-N-Ride” locations where a person(s) can get in their “Pod” and enjoy their commute with a steady and predictable arrival time. 
      Each pod would be designed to accompany 2, 4 or 6 people for the larger groups. People can check in from Google Maps and/or other Google compatible apps/devices to check current and expected wait times. Additionally, the user can check into their “Pod” via the Google app and it will take you to the closest station to your final destination.

Why gondolas?
      By lifting mass transportation off the ground it bypasses the congestion of cars, trucks, busses, ect. Also, it provides a steady flow making arrival times more consistent and predictable.

How would the Google Pods system be powered?
     With lots of moving parts and maintenance in mind, catwalks between poles could provide support for solar panels and each pole could extend further up to accommodate wind turbines.

     As a former resident of Washington who had to commute into downtown for work via personal and public transportation I have can vouch for the extended travel times it takes. Time is valuable and if we can give people an option of personal space while not having to own a car while at the same time taking more personal vehicles out of the mix, it could create a much happier, productive and vibrant city. 

     Not only would this system create a reliable transportation schedule for the people who live here, it would also become a kind of attraction also allowing people who are visiting a great way to navigate the city with much more ease and comfort.

     In addition, if the main hubs worked similar to that of a post office. Amazon could ship packages and produce to the users end destination for pick up on their way home.

     With the advances of technology with self operating warehouses and self driving cars, I truly believe this idea could revolutionize the public transportation industry in any major city that requires people from miles around to commute.

     This is a very rough outline and could be adapted in many ways in many large cities where commuter traffic often grinds to a stand still. Our most valuable asset is time, and time in traffic is time wasted.",3qnox,1621954391

Lets take this up a notch and brain storm on some really absurd crazy ideas on more advanced ways to harness this Solar Energy.

I'll go first:

Advanced Solar Thermal Conversion.

We all have used a magnifying glass to set a paper on fire by concentration of heat from the Sun, which in essence is energy. A magnifying glass with a diameter of 1 meter is powerful enough to melt Stone. 

What is we can use this procedure, advance it by making this technique amplify the power of the concentrated beam several times higher, have that amplified and concentrated beam through something that will convert that energy into usable green energy or  store it?

It is a vague concept but then again I am not a scientist or engineer but have these crazy weird ideas and visions inside my head. Lol.

But maybe you guys have some more ideas to share? Maybe we can do something to help reduce carbon emissions from our planet and be able to produce a self sustainable energy cycle for humanity?

9491,It is entirely impossible to start and keep a record of every time you experience Deja-Vu,"I've been reading Watchmen and seeing how Dr.Manhattan experiences time (all at once, simultaneously) and after following a very long train of thought through my very basic understanding of quantum states, the relationship between speed and time, and Einstein's quote ""[linear time] is a stubbornly persistent illusion"", I have arrived at a wacky hypothesis:

From the moment that you commit to keeping a record of every time you experience Deja-Vu (and also commit to re-read that record regularly), you can never experience Deja-Vu again. 

(No I'm not high or insane, hear me out) 

If time is not linear, the phenomenon of deja vu could be a memory of something that you haven't done yet. For example, you could get deja vu walking into a building that you've never been to before. Common enough, probably happens somewhere every day, but if time is not linear, there's no such thing as ""before"" or ""after"". Therefore if, in your lifetime, you go to this building twice, Deja-Vu could be a memory of the other time that you went to that building. If the other time is in the past (or what we experience as ""the past"") we'd call that a regular old memory. If (much much rarer for some reason) the other time is in the future, we'd refer to that as Deja-Vu. 

But.

If time is not linear, the future (no such thing) is set. Fate or destiny or determinism or whatever you care to call it exists, because the future and present and past have already happened (if ""happening"" is even a thing). The future would be as unchangeable as the past and the present. Whatever decisions you made and will make in your lifetime are pre-set. They're set by you, but who you are and the factors that determine the way you make decisions are set as well. Whatever you choose to do, you were always going to choose to do. 

Therefore: If you decide that you're going to keep track of each instance of Deja-Vu you experience (and to re-read that record regularly enough that it never completely fades from your memory), that knowledge would affect your actions in the (what we call) future. If you went into that building, felt Deja-Vu, and wrote down in your notebook that that's where you felt it, then whenever the next time came that you were about to enter that building, your memory of that experience would change your state of mind when you walked in. ""oh, I'm about to walk into that place I had deja vu six years ago!""

But that'd be impossible. Because then your deja vu moment (the one from the future you remembered when you went in the first time) wouldn't happen the way you remembered it. And if it didn't happen, you couldn't have remembered it, because it didn't happen!

Which means ultimately, if time is indeed not linear as we have decided/discovered and deja vu is a memory of the future that slips through the quantum gaps of observation somehow, it must be impossible to keep a personal record of instances of deja vu. 

Advanced mode: Unless! Unless your deja vu experience when walking into the building is of you remembering the time that you had Deja-Vu when you walked into the building. (In other words, you would be: remembering the moment in the future when you remembered the moment that is currently happening as you enter the building). Then it could happen.

9533,Everyone should be forced to watch at least one person die.,"Humanity is a sensitive and very polarized subject, arguments on where we come from and why we exist have resulted in countless conflicts. I believe at the center of these conflicts is the inability to understand what it is that makes us human, and what makes us care for each other. That being said, there is one thing unarguably that all humans have in common and can be understood universally. We will all die one day. 

Watching someone else die is definitely a harsh reality few of us want to be exposed to. The reality of our current society though, is most people don’t empathize to the full extent. Including myself—we give little thought to war, plague, and starvation around the world. The urge to survive exists in every person, this urge to survive and succeed can blind us. 

When we as a whole fail to teach of the cruel reality our society was created in, we fail to show the true aspects of human. The people making the decisions for the soldiers, the plagued, and the hungry are the ones who have failed to see what it is like to die in those methods. To see someone starve to death is to understand how fragile life is. Seeing the last breath of someone clinging to life will change your views. It’s my belief that if you don’t see these things, you will not truly understand the full development of humans and how we got to where we are now. The second issue that goes along with that, is many people don’t want to see these things—and I don’t blame them. 

It’s also worth mentioning, no one innocent should die. Death shouldn’t be used only for informational purposes, and shouldn’t be used to instill fear. I only wish through this extreme method, that we could find some understanding in eachother. 

Tl;Dr - Making all members of the population view at least 1 horrific death would result in more basic empathy and appreciation for fellow human life.",Extericore,1621609934

The medical dumpster fire in our country needs to end, and one way to put it out of business is to introduce competition by asserting the right of competent adults to make their own choices, risky or not. The reason that right is being restricted isn't (simply) because drugs are dangerous, you can go BASE jumping or paragliding which is more dangerous but not illegal, it's to increase profits for the medical cartel. I would get rid of prescription requirements entirely, but many believe it's also the government's duty to protect stupid people from their own decisions. This kind of licensing satisfies that requirement. Though note that driver's licenses are only for driving on public roads, and are required to keep the driver from being a harm *to other people*. It's not illegal to drive on your own property without one, even if you suck at driving and are risking your life, because it's yours to risk.

9595,Cargo train companies should be encouraging graffiti artists to paint their train cars instead of prosecuting them for it.,"Here are my reasons:

1. Paint helps to prevent rust. We have a situation where volunteers are willing to bring their own paint, at their own expense, to paint metal train cars. Corrosion will almost certainly be the death of most of these cars. They would last longer if they were painted.
2. Encouraging graffiti would incentivize artists and de-incentivize vandals. The way I see it, there are essentially 2 reasons why people make illegal street art - because they enjoy making art, and/or because breaking the law is a rush, or because 'fuck the man' or whatever. If you encourage people to do it, you do away with the vandal element; the only people who show up are the artists. The quality of work is bound to increase.
3. A train car covered in graffiti is more interesting, and usually more aesthetically appealing that a blank train car. I drive to different cities and towns for work, and I see a lot of trains. I don't mind graffiti at all, in fact I appreciate it. Train cars are really boring looking and even ugly on their own. People rarely take the time and paint to paint something vulgar or insulting on a train car. Hell, they usually aren't even political. It's almost always the same, big, aesthetically pleasing swoopy-name thing.

* notifications when policies change
* accessing a service shows what terms are applicable in a given context such as those for a website
* see at a glance what conditions apply to the user such as indemnification clauses.

Legal documents that state a valid action are supported through the interface if there is a digital procedure to fulfil such a request, such as a refund.

Does a severe lack of mass cause time to speed up? 

White holes are predicted by Einstein’s equations. 

Theory:
White Holes = Dark Energy = lack of mass causing time to speed to infinity which creates more space in the voids of our universe pushing galaxy clusters apart.

Thought. 
Dark matter could be small black holes we haven’t detected yet. Could a lack of mass in the outer areas of galaxies cause time to speed up, thus making those portions of the galaxy clusters orbit faster.

9772,Mega Game of Life,"Alright, so apparently there are multiple Games of Life; not like the brand ones, but different parts of life.

All Different Games of Life:
OG Game of life
Game of Life Jr
Game of Life Adventures
Game of Life Empire
Game of Life High School Edition
Game of Life A Day in the Dog Park

(Btw I'm going to use GOF for Game of Life)

Full Explanation:
So, you and up to 23 more players (because of all the games) all start at GOF Jr, which goes through childhood. Then, when you finish the GOF Jr, without waiting for the other players, go to GOF High School Edition, which you play through the entirety of. 
Next in line is the OG GOF. Now, here's the slightly complicated part. In the middle of the OG GOF (or wherever you want), you go play the entirety of GOF A Day in the Dog Park. Once you finish that, you head back to the part you left off in the OG GOF.
Once you finally finish the OG GOF, you retire right? Nah. You get to chose the next Game of Life. At the end of the GOF OG, you get the choice of Millionaire Estates or Countryside Acres. Whichever you choose, thats the path you're taking.
If you pick Millionaire Estates, you then play through the entirety of GOF Empire. If you pick Countryside Acres, you then have to play GOF Adventures.
Once you finish GOF Empire or Adventures, then you finally finish completely.

9776,"Digital ""fly-by-wire"" controls on a gas cooktop."," I've seen recipes telling the cook to ""adjust heat as necessary to maintain x (simmer, specific temp on an instant-read thermometer, etc)"". I've seen the statistics that 75% of cooking fires start in the kitchen on the stovetop. I've heard that you should NOT use high heat with a non-stick pan. I've also left a pan on low and forgotten about it. (I'm visually impaired and often can't see the tiny flame.)

So here's my idea: computer-controlled gas valves on stoves, controlled by encoder knobs on the front of the stove. **Thermocouple sensors** would continuously monitor pans on the cooktop. One would have **incredibly precise, percent-by-percent control** of the burner. If a pan was lifted off the burner while it was on, there would be a ""dingdingdingding..."" chime and the burner would automatically shut off 10 seconds later. To turn the burner off manually, the user would hold the control dial inward for 3 seconds.

Additionally, the user could push the control dial inward while cooking and be able to have the **current pan temperature maintained**. If the pan dropped below the temp recorded when you set this ""cruise control"", the burner would turn up (if it wasn't already on high). If the pan temp rose above the setpoint, the burner would turn down (if it wasn't on low). Turning the control knob would cancel the ""cruise control"", giving you full control again. If the cooktop was unable to maintain the setpoint using full high or low heat, a chime would sound and the system would give you control.

**Smart speaker integration** would allow you to adjust the cooktop with your voice, and the cooktop could also be integrated with recipes to follow cooking instructions autonomously. Your smart speaker could also give warnings (""caution high temperature"", ""warning pan overheating"", etc.)

A safety feature only possible with this fly-by-wire system is **automatic pan protection.** When turning the stove on you would tell the computer what type of pan you were using (cast iron, nonstick, or other). When using a non-stick pan, the computer would warn you and start to turn down the burner when the pan hit 475 Fahrenheit. If you ignored the warning, the computer would maintain 475 until further notice. You would still have control and could turn the dial up if you really needed maximum heat, or turn it down to lower the flame, but it wouldn't be possible to exceed 500 degrees with a nonstick pan. The burner would turn itself down to prevent it. If the pan temp hit 500 and continued to rise, there would be a continuous warning chime (dingdingdingding...). The burner would shut off 5 seconds later.

Regardless of pan type, **excessive pan temperature (600+ Fahrenheit) would result in the burner shutting off** to prevent cooking oil from causing a fire. A warning chime would sound until the affected pan dropped below 500 degrees. The manufacturer of an appliance with this control system could have the option to add a button (perhaps behind a little ""fighter-jet cover""), to allow the user to manually stop the chime.

The entire system would be **redundant**. It would give the user full control and operate as a regular stove if the temp sensors went out. A small battery would power the cooktop for up to an hour (the servos and the tiny microcontroller are super-efficient) in the event of a power outage.

TL: DR - **precision control, ability to follow recipes by itself, automatic fire prevention, and Teflon pan protection.**

9781,A dating app that balances out the like ratio between men and women and reduces the amount of creepy guys and hyper inflated egos of girls.,"So everyone knows that dating apps suck for guys but like playing on easy mode for girls.


This leads to there being an over saturated amount of women with inflated egos and desperate and creepy guys. Obviously girls hate dealing with the creepy guys that only want them for sex and guys hate dealing with these egotistical girls so why not make an app that balances this.


The app would work somewhat like tinder where you just swipe to like someone except there’s a catch. 

For girls it works basically the same. 100 likes a day and you stop swiping when you run out. For guys the is where the difference occurs. Instead of 100 likes a day a guy only gets 25. 
During these 25 likes the app would try to put as many potential matches in as possible to try to give you the same amount of enjoyment as you would on tinder with 100 likes.  


This would cause a shift in the supply and demand market. Since the supply of male likes has gone down the likelihood of a female “purchasing” a male like at a lower quality goes up. 

Conversely the supply of female likes goes up so the likelihood of a male “purchasing” a female like at a lower quality goes down. 

Depending on the supply and demand the daily amount of allocated likes would change to try to balance out the number of likes on guys and girls. 

This, hopefully, would balance out the problems discussed in the first few sentences. 

Since males have less likes it is less likely that they’ll waste a like on a female that they’re just trying to use for sex which would hopefully weed out the creepy guys. 

Conversely females would be getting less likes therefore hopefully deflating the over inflated egos.",redditcontrolme_enon,1621114994

Now... I am having second thoughts about using the new space (×2 current shop size) only as an extension of the current showroom.

you have a battery (figuritively) with 5 bars. every work day one bar goes away.

monday = 5 tuesday = 4 wednesday = 3 tuesday = 2 friday = 1 saturday = 0 sunday = 5

it takes 2 days to recover the 5 bars, with one just being exhausting because you have 0 bars (saturday). but if you make it so when it has to charge, you have more bars you dont have one day where you dont wanna do anything, and make it a better day. so we make sunday a workday, and wednesday a day where you dont have to work. allow me to demonstrate.

monday = 5 tuesday = 4 wednesday = 5 tuesday = 4 friday = 3 sunday = 5

because we need to charge less, it charges faster on wedesday and sunday instead of 2 days for 5 bars. you would probably be more motivated because normally the weekend would feel like 1 day because of saturday, and you wish there was another day off so you feel like you had 2 days weekend. but now it really is 1 day, and you have 2 or 3 consecutive work days, instead of 5, also making you more motivated because you have less workdays infront of you, morally.",spoofthatping,1620758685

9962,Movie: How to fight an Alien Invasion,"We think that we could fight off an Alien attack when, in reality, we're completely helpless.

A movie where Aliens make contact to let us know they will arrive in 10 Earth years and we believe their intentions to be sinister so we start preparing for war. I mean that the WHOLE OF PLANET EARTH is ready for these mf's!  
The movie spends a solid 95% of the movie here - it shows us developing kick-ass technology and really spends the time to develop characters and relationships. All problems of the Earth and it's people are resolved and we really come together as a planet. We really are 100% ready and it's just massively uplifting - think 'Endgame portals' style.  
It would solidify that we're 100% prepared and ready for any attack they come down with. Heck, we even have super humans somehow!

&amp;#x200B;

After 10 years the Aliens turn up and are like, 'WTF is wrong with these idiots' and just lightly push a rock from the Keiper belt towards us which destroys Earth and wipes out 99.99% of life - including all humans.  
The movie then spends 5 min showing the Aliens come down and 'clean up' the non-natural occurring things (e.g. plastic) and insert some Alien DNA into one of the creatures that has survived and continues on like 'oh well' to the next planet... 'See you guys again in a few million years'.

The audience leaves thinking, 'wtf was the point of all of that?!' - The answer being that the point was capitalism and I took your money to watch my movie. Now, tell your friends about what you think should have happened so that they can pay money to watch my movie and tell their friends about it.",KingTonyI,1620696744

9968,"Top Ramen that is nutritionally complete, or close to it","When times are hard, a lot of people eat Top Ramen to get by. It's tasty, filling, and very inexpensive. The only problem is it's not a complete diet. You can't live on ramen alone.

But what if you could? There is a product called ""[Soylent](https://soylent.com/)"" (yes, it's kind of a joke name) that is nutritionally complete, and it comes in a shake form. The problem is that many people wouldn't seek this out or find it. You can almost eat nothing but Soylent and be healthy.

If someone made a nutritionally complete Top Ramen it would really help a lot of poor people, because they are already eating this food. You would just help them without needing to do a massive advertising campaign to change consumer behavior.",rhinokitty,1620686940

Maybe there is a wild animal trying to attack you? You can intimidate it with your poop. 

Maybe you're about to get a speeding ticket. Keeping some poop in your vehicle can be one of the fastest ways out of this situation.

Tired of your in laws coming over? That won't happen anymore once you start saving your poop.

There's practically no downside.",-0-O-,1620675533

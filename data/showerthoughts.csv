217,The soup theory: Soup Boss and Anti Soup Boss,"-Soup theory-
This theory of mine isn't specific to soup, but i like calling it the soup theory nonetheless.
So, basically, let's say you like soup. You have a friend who also likes soup. Now, even though you both like soup, your friend likes soup more than you do. Now take another random person- that person likes soup even more than your friend does. Repeat that into oblivion and you will get to the Soup Boss. The person who loves soup the most out of all the people on this earth. (This could expand to the entire universe/multiverse but let's not get into that). You could apply the same logic to disliking soup in order to get to the Anti Soup Boss.
Now that we established that there must person who loves soup more than anyone in this world and a person that hates soup more than anyone in this world, we must ask the question.

2790,The circle but irl,"So there’s this show on Netflix called The Circle. It’s a social media thing and I don’t fully get the whole premise but what I want to talk about is this - the contestants can either be who they are or pretend to be completely different people. So this one guy in the first episodes uses his girlfriend’s pics and is portraying her. A few other dudes do this and I think some girls do too at some point. What struck me about this (after watching a few episodes of this admittedly terrible reality show) is that this premise could be used for good. Remember how 16 and pregnant resulted in way fewer teen pregnancies? (Pretty sure this is true, there have been studies)… what if we had a TV show which focused on men being women and vice versa. I’m not talking catfish per se but sorta. I’m saying have men act as women online, try online dating and finding a job (LinkedIn?) and an apartment and applying to college and etc etc, and have women pretend to be men and do the same. They pick the pictures that they want to represent them, they come up with whatever personalities they want (could be their own, could be whoever), they follow through with this experiment. Men, try being a woman online for awhile. Do what you want to do but experience it from the different side of the sex spectrum. Women, try being a man online for awhile.

The guy on the circle who’s pretending to be his girlfriend has had some really sweet and unexpected insights. I think everyone could benefit from insights like that, from experiencing what it’s like to be a different gender. I just think it could be a fun tv show too.

TLDR tv show with online personas where guys pretend to be girls and girls pretend to be guys 🤷‍♀️",caitlandeh,1643152519

4769,"If the universe could think, it would probably have the same fears that we do","I've spent some time recently watching videos about space and time and how eventually the universe will dissipate into endless darkness, and it got me thinking about how closely the 'universal truths' mirror our own 'personal truths'. I have always believed that to some degree we are part of the universe and that essentially our perception is the universe trying to figure itself out. And if you compare our micro issues, to the macro issues facing the universe, there is perhaps more correlation that you might expect.

1. Darkness/Being Alone - Our fear of the darkness is generally compounded by the fear of being alone. And as the universe expands the lights are going out, the horizon is slipping away. It's like a scene in any horror movie, where the corridor is slowly disappearing from your view. The fate of everything is ultimately absolute and permanent loneliness. 

2. The loss of information/thinking - Losing your memory and your legacy disappearing into nothingness is a scary thought. For many people Alzheimer's or a stroke is perhaps the greatest fear, that you will begin to lose your sense of self. The same is true for the universe, as it spreads out, the interconnection of information will be lost, there will be no way to reconcile what was once there. And eventually it will pass into nothingness as if it never existed at all. 

3. Introspection - Looking inside one's own mind can leave you feeling rather empty and depressed, particularly as you identify your own limitations. Considering the points above, and that the universe, through us, is beginning to recognise its own fatal end, and also its own intellectual limitations. It will never be what it was, its best days are behind it. It is now just a fading memory of what it once was. 

4. Fear of the unknown - Assuming the universe has eyes (i.e. people), it can only see so far. What sits beyond the event horizon is the unknown. Is there something beyond, will the universe be torn to shreds by collision with another larger universe, who knows what is lurking just beyond the door. 

Perhaps the Universe is just playing out a few billion little human lives in an attempt to understand its own impending imperilment.",Hannibal_Lecture,1643023903

It really sucked and hitring my elbow or small tow on something were probably the most painful things I knew at that age, until I fell on the fence.

But still, I would take that to a bad period. I didn't give birth, but most people would agree they are more painful than a period. So, no, getting kicked in the balls is likely not more painful.
